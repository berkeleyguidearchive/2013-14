<a name="overview"></a>
<h4><br/>
<strong>Overview</strong></h4>




<p>The Department of Gender and Women's Studies offers interdisciplinary perspectives on the formation of gender and its intersections with other relations of power, such as sexuality, race, class, nationality, religion, and age. Questions are addressed within the context of a transnational world and from perspectives as diverse as history, sociology, literary and cultural studies, postcolonial theory, science, new technology, and art.</p>




<p>The undergraduate program is designed to introduce students to gender and women's studies, focusing on gender as a category of analysis and on the workings of power in social and historical life. The department offers an introduction to feminist theory as well as more advanced courses that seek to expand capacities for critical reflection and analysis and to engage students with varied approaches to feminist scholarship. The curriculum draws students into interdisciplinary analysis of specific gender practices in areas such as feminism in a transnational world, the politics of representation, feminist science studies, women and work, women and film, gender and health, and the politics of childhood.</p>




<p>The department offers an undergraduate major and minor. It also houses an undergraduate minor in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) studies, a program whose courses overlap productively with feminist and gender studies. Faculty in the department collaborate with an extensive group of extended faculty through the Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender and Sexuality, which provides graduate students across campus with a site for transdisciplinary learning and teaching. The department is now in the process of developing a PhD program in Transnational Studies of Women and Gender. The department fosters connections with scholars in feminist and sexuality studies throughout the campus by cross-listing courses, collaborating in research, and participating in the Gender Consortium, which links research and teaching units that focus on gender.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="majorrequirements"></a>
<h4><strong>Major Requirements</strong></h4>




<h5>Prerequisites</h5>




<p>To declare the gender and women's studies major, students must have completed GWS 10 and GWS 20 and have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0.</p>




<h5>Upper Division Requirements</h5>




<p>The requirements for a gender and women's studies major consist of a minimum of eight upper division courses on gender and women's issues (30-32 units) distributed as follows:</p>




<ul>
	<li><strong>Core courses (20 units):</strong> 101, Doing Feminist Research; 102, Transnational Feminisms; 103, Identities Across Difference; 104, Feminist Theory; 195, Senior Seminar.</li>
	<li><strong>Electives (10-12 units):</strong> Three electives, at least one in the Department of Gender and Women's Studies; the other two may be fulfilled by classes offered by other departments that are listed in <em>Courses on Gender and Women,</em> published each semester by the Department of Gender and Women's Studies.</li>
</ul>




<a name="honorsprogram"></a>
<h4><br/>
<strong>Honors Program</strong></h4>




<p>To be eligible for the GWS Honors Program (GWS H195), students must have an overall 3.3 GPA, a 3.5 GPA in the major, and receive an A in GWS 195.</p>




<p>To receive honors in GWS, students must have a 3.6 for honors, a 3.8 for high honors, or a 3.9 for highest honors. In addition, the student must receive a minimum of an A- in GWS H195.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="minorrequirements"></a>
<h4><strong>Minor Requirements</strong></h4>




<h5>Gender and Women's Studies</h5>




<p>Students in the College of Letters and Science may complete one or more minors of their choice, normally in a field both academically and administratively distinct from their major. To be admitted to the minor in gender and women's studies, students must complete GWS 10. Minors in gender and women's studies must complete five upper division courses as follows: any three of the core courses (GWS 101, 102, 103, 104) plus two electives in gender and women's studies. A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for the minor program.</p>




<h5><strong>LGBT Studies</strong></h5>




<p>LGBT Studies works to establish sexuality as a crucial category of analysis in the humanities and social sciences. It draws on disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology, history, literature, and cultural studies, in order to document the extent to which sexuality itself is a complex cultural and historical phenomenon that bears careful examination. Just as Women's Studies, for instance, is not only by, about, and for women, LGBT Studies is not only by, about, or for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trangendered people, but includes all humanity in its purview.</p>




<p>This minor is organized around four core courses: an introductory overview of LGBT culture and history in the US; a visual and literary studies course; a cross-cultural studies course; and a history of sexuality course. In addition to these core courses, students are required to take two electives, which are approved each year by the director and posted online. Teaching is largely done by about 12 ladder-rank faculty.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="prerequisitesfornonmajorsandminors"></a>
<h4><strong>Prerequisites for Nonmajors and Minors</strong></h4>




<p>Students who are not majoring or minoring in gender and women's studies but wish to take gender and women's studies core courses (101, 102, 103, and 104) must take GWS 10, GWS 20, or their equivalent beforehand.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="graduateprogramdesignatedemphasisinwomengenderandsexuality"></a>
<h4><strong>Graduate Program: Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender, and Sexuality</strong></h4>




<p>PhD students at Berkeley may add a Designated Emphasis (DE) in Women, Gender, and Sexuality (DEWGS) to their major fields. Designed to enhance interdisciplinary graduate studies at Berkeley, the DEWGS provides curricular and research resources and opportunities to students who are already admitted to graduate degree programs on campus.</p>




<p>The designated emphasis program was developed to accommodate some of the many students who conduct graduate-level research in related topics across numerous fields. Administered by the Department of Gender and Women's Studies, the designated emphasis program provides its students with certification as well as with a context for the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and development of research.</p>




<p>Applicants will be selected according to their academic qualifications, the appropriateness of their interests to the program's teaching resources, and the enrollment capacity of its graduate seminars. To be admitted to the program, applicants must already be accepted into an existing PhD program at Berkeley <em>(master’s students and students at other institutions are not eligible).</em> Graduate students should apply in their third semester for admission to the program in their fourth semester. Students must apply before completing their qualifying examinations.</p>




<p>Students admitted to the designated emphasis program will be enrolled in the required introductory seminar (GWS 200) offered each spring. Students must fulfill the following requirements before completion of the degree: The introductory seminar (GWS 200), an elective seminar (GWS 210), and a dissertation research seminar (GWS 220). A member of the Department of Gender and Women's Studies or it's Affiliated Faculty must be on the qualifying examination committee; a topic on women/gender/sexuality must be on the qualifying examination, and a member of the department or Affiliated Faculty must be on the dissertation committee.</p>




<p>For more detailed information concerning this program, students should consult the department.</p>
