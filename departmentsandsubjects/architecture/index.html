<h4><br/>
Department Overview</h4>




<p>The Department of Architecture at UC Berkeley has a strong tradition of fostering independent design thinking and research. Our award-winning faculty offer vigorous undergraduate and graduate educational programs and carry out leading research in constructed and virtual environments, architectural technologies, and architectural humanities. The multidisciplinary interests of our faculty and graduate students form the basis of exciting new research collaborations with a variety of other disciplines, including anthropology, international studies, engineering, new media, and urban studies.</p>




<p>Architecture is more than design. To create livable environments means balancing complex social, political, economic, and technical requirements with human needs. Students take courses in environmental history, behavioral sciences, resource management, and design theory, as well as in the technical, aesthetic, and cultural components of design. The department prides itself on educating not only good architects, but also environmentally knowledgeable citizens.</p>

<h4>School Philosophy</h4>




<h5>Undergraduate Philosophy</h5>




<p>Undergraduate study in the College of Environmental Design provides a liberal education among an active community of students, scholars, creative designers, and technologists concerned with the built environment, within the larger environment of a great university.</p>




<h5>Graduate Philosophy</h5>




<p>The graduate programs in architecture aims to educate architects and scholars who contribute to the practice and discipline of architecture and to the development of a technologically sophisticated and humane built environment. The professional program is intended to develop students' abilities to conceive and accurately describe appropriate built spaces at several scales, to help them learn the processes used to bring buildings into place, and to provide a basis for understanding the consequences that complexes of buildings and open spaces have for inhabitants, society, and the environment.</p>




<p>In both its undergraduate and graduate programs, the department puts special emphasis on the studio element of its academic program, recruiting active architecture professionals to work in consultation with regular faculty in leading the courses.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="spanundergraduateprogramspan"></a>
<h4><span>Undergraduate Program</span></h4>




<p>Berkeley's undergraduate program in architecture leads to the bachelor of arts (B.A.) degree. The program combines required courses in environmental design and architecture with opportunities for highly varied individual programs. Through its core courses, the program offers a broad introduction to the field of architecture, and through studies in the various areas it provides opportunities to prepare for specialization in the field in the areas of architectural design and representation, architectural technologies and building performance, architectural history, and society and culture. In addition to offering a sound and well-rounded education, undergraduate studies can also provide pre-professional competency for entry-level employment in architecture, the option for graduate work in architecture, or further studies in a related environmental design field.</p>




<p>Some graduates go on to obtain professional degrees in architecture or in other related fields; many others work in architectural practice, construction, government, or industry. Employment opportunities exist also at the community level, particularly in those communities that traditionally have not been served by professional architectural practice. The overall aim of the undergraduate program is to establish a strong foundation for a diversity of careers and to provide for mobility and flexibility to suit changing individual opportunities.</p>




<h5>Course of Study</h5>




<p>All undergraduates follow the same path through their junior year. In the first two years, students take a breadth of lower-division courses and the introductory environmental design courses. The junior year is architecture-intensive. In the fall semester, students take a design studio and a history and humanities option. In the spring, the required courses include another studio, a course in history and a technology option.</p>




<h5><strong>Program Tracks</strong></h5>




<p>During the spring semester of the junior year, students choose either a project track or a studio track for the senior year:</p>




<ul>
	<li><strong>Project Track: </strong>The project track option explores a particular theme for both the fall and spring semesters of the senior year. This theme changes each year, and is taught by a group of faculty members on a subject of their shared interest. For the fall semester, students enroll in a project preparation seminar, and for the spring semester, students take a studio — led by the same faculty — in which they develop their research and explorations, culminating in a design project and documented in a pamphlet.</li>
	<li><strong>Studio Track: </strong>The studio track option is studio-intensive, with more architecture courses required in addition to a design studio each semester. Studio-track students enroll in a structures course in the fall, and choose between an energy and environment or construction course in the spring.</li>
</ul>




<h5>Accreditation/Licensure</h5>




<p>The BA degree is a pre-professional degree and provides the foundation for entry to a Master of Architecture program, the most widespread professional degree program in architecture in the United States. The B.A. degree can also be applied toward licensing requirements in the State of California. See the <a href="http://www.naab.org/" target="_blank">National Architectural Accrediting Board</a>
 (NAAB) for more information on accreditation. See the <a href="http://www.cab.ca.gov/" target="_blank">California Architects Board</a>
 and the <a href="http://ncarb.org/" target="_blank">National Council of Architectural Registration Boards</a>
 (NCARB) for more information on licensing.</p>

<a name="graduateprograms"></a>
<h4>Graduate Programs</h4>




<p>The department offers the accredited professional degree Master of Architecture, the research degrees Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy, and several other degree programs as described below.</p>




<a name="masterofarchitecture"></a>
<h4>Master of Architecture</h4>




<p>The Master of Architecture program is designed to provide students seeking their first accredited professional degree with a comprehensive and challenging education leading to the practice of architecture. Graduate students have the flexibility to choose a variety of paths within a two-to-three-year rigorous program, depending upon previous education and experience. The department makes no restriction as to the field of undergraduate preparation. However, the length of the required residence period, the number of required semester course units, and the specific list of required courses may vary depending upon undergraduate major, professional and other work experience, and previous graduate study, if any.</p>




<p>Additional prerequisites for admission to the professional Master of Architecture program are college-level or equivalent mathematics through analytical geometry and beginning calculus and beginning physics through mechanics.</p>




<p>A required studio each semester introduces design issues through the study of a variety of building types, styles, and sites. The curriculum in technology and building performance, history, society and culture, structures and construction and professional practice provides the breadth and background for the individual's professional education and career goals. Students who have completed equivalent courses at other institutions may have the requirements waived to allow for more elective units.</p>




<p>The basic course leading to the Master of Architecture degree takes three academic years and requires the completion of at least 72 units during that period of residence. Persons who hold a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree with a major in architecture may receive up to one year of advanced standing. The Master of Architecture Committee of the department will determine the specific amount of advanced standing individually for each student at the time she or he first registers for graduate study in the department. Special one-year Master of Architecture programs are available to persons holding the five-year, professional undergraduate degree, Bachelor of Architecture, from an accredited school, or comparable five-year degrees from foreign universities and technical institutes.</p>




<p>In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the preprofessional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</p>




<p>[Name of university, name of academic unit] offers the following NAABaccredited degree program(s) (<em>If an institution offers more than one</em> <em>track for an M.Arch or D.Arch. based on the type of</em> <em>undergraduate/preparatory education required, please list all tracks</em> <em>separately)</em>:</p>




<p>[Name of degree] (Prerequisite + total number of credits required) In addition, the program is required to publish the year of the next accreditation visit for each accredited program.</p>




<h5>Master of Science Degree in Architecture</h5>




<p>This nonprofessional degree program offers the opportunity for advanced research in specialized areas within the architecture curriculum. A research degree, it is appropriate for those who already hold a degree in architecture but wish to study a particular subfield. Applicants from related disciplines may be accepted into the program, provided they demonstrate experience related to the discipline of architecture. Depending upon previous preparation, students are required to complete a minimum of 32 to 48 credit units, including a combined research methods course taught by a faculty team. Remaining coursework will be determined by the nature of the proposed research. A research thesis culminates the student's program. Further information about requirements for admission and application materials may be obtained from the department's graduate assistant.</p>




<h5>Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree in Architecture</h5>




<p>This advanced degree prepares students with outstanding academic records for research and teaching in architecture and environmental design. It is a research-oriented program, in which the student chooses specific fields of specialization, prepares sufficiently in the literature and research of those fields to pass written and oral examinations, and completes original research culminating in the written dissertation. The PhD program provides detailed focus in specific study areas, including architectural design theory and criticism;  architectural technologies, including building science,  and building performance; the history of architecture and urban design; environmental design in developing countries;  and the social and cultural basis of design.</p>




<p>For the PhD program, applicants should review the Graduate Division requirements with respect to admission, language requirements, candidacy, and the dissertation regulations. Applicants must hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, but the department makes no restriction as to the discipline of the undergraduate preparation. Additional information is available from the departmental graduate assistant.</p>




<h5>Program in Visual Studies (Master of Arts Degree in Design)</h5>




<p>There is a small program in Visual Studies at the graduate level leading to the Master of Arts degree in design. Students with an interest in pursuing graduate work involved with visual design issues may apply.</p>




<p>The present degree is offered under Plan 1 of the Graduate Division, which requires 20 semester units plus a thesis. The length of time required for completion varies with the individual, depending in part upon previous preparation. An undergraduate degree from the College of Environmental Design or in an art-related field is helpful but not necessary. The principal emphasis in the admission process is on the portfolio that all applicants for admission to the graduate program must submit.</p>




<h5>Concurrent Program with the Department of City and Regional Planning</h5>




<p>The Department of Architecture and the Department of City and Regional Planning offer a concurrent degree program leading to the dual M.Arch. and M.C.P. degrees for students holding the five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree or a four-year Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science degree in architecture, or equivalent degrees in related disciplines. The Master of City Planning degree portion of the concurrent program requires completion of 36 semester units; the M.Arch. segment calls for 24-72 semester units, depending upon the undergraduate degree. Applicants should indicate that they wish to be considered for the Concurrent Program in Architecture and City and Regional Planning when completing the UC Berkeley Graduate Application.</p>




<h5>Concurrent Program with the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning</h5>




<p>The Departments of Architecture and Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning offer a concurrent degree program. This program will lead to two professional degrees: Master of Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture. The program brings together two closely connected branches of environmental design—the design of sites and the design of buildings. This program is for exceptionally qualified students who have an undergraduate degree in architecture or landscape architecture and who satisfy the admission requirements of the one- or two-year M.Arch. program and/or the two-year M.L.A. program. Applicants should indicate that they wish to be considered for the Concurrent Program in Architecture and Landscape Architecture when completing the UC Berkeley Graduate Application. Acceptance into the concurrent degree program is limited to outstanding applicants. More information may be obtained from the Graduate Office in 202 Wurster Hall or from the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning website at <a href="http://laep.ced.berkeley.edu">laep.ced.berkeley.edu</a>
.</p>





<h5>Concurrent Degree Program with the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Division of Structural Engineering, Mechanics, and Materials</h5>




<p>The two departments offer a joint program with a concurrent degree for exceptionally qualified students. Students must fulfill the course requirements for both departments but are allowed a reduction in elective units that will achieve a savings in the time enrolled, varying from one semester to one year, depending on undergraduate preparation. Some engineering courses are prerequisite to entering the program or may be taken during the first year of enrollment without credit toward the minimum course requirements. Applicants should indicate that they wish to be considered for the Concurrent Program in Architecture and Civil and Environmental Engineering when completing the UC Berkeley Graduate Application.</p>




<h5>Concurrent MA in International and Area Studies</h5>




<p>The concurrent M.A. program in International and Area Studies (IAS) is designed to complement the graduate degree programs in architecture. It is intended to produce graduate students who combine advanced professional training with a detailed knowledge of contemporary international issues or particular world areas or countries. The content of each M.A. program will be shaped in consultation with the departmental IAS adviser to meet the specific needs and interests of the individual student.</p>




<p>In addition to satisfying all Graduate Division and departmental requirements for the Master of Architecture, MS, or PhD degrees, students in this concurrent program must complete a minimum of 24 units outside architecture in the special area agreed upon with the IAS adviser.</p>




<p>For additional information on these degree programs, please see <a href="http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/programs" target="_blank">arch.ced.berkeley.edu/programs</a>

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This class introduces students to the history and practice of design theory from the late 19th century to the present, with emphasis on developments of the last four decades. Readings and lectures explore specific constellations of theory and practice in relation to changing social and historical conditions. The course follows the rise of modernist design thinking, with particular emphasis on the growing influence of technical rationality across multiple fields in the post World War II period. Systematic approaches based in cybernetics and operations research (amongst others) are examined in the context of wider attempts to develop a science of design. Challenges to modernist design thinking, through advocacy planning and community-based design, the influence of social movements and countercultures, and parallel developments in postmodernism within and beyond architecture, provide the critical background for consideration of recent approaches to design theory, including those informed by developments in digital media and technology, environmental and ecological concerns, questions surrounding the globalization of architectural production, and the development of new materials.

The course presents the fundamentals of building science while recongnizing the evolving nature of building technologies, energy efficiency, ecology, and responsible design. The course begins with a detailed explication of the thermal properties of materials, heat transfer through building assemblies, balance point temperature, solar geometry, and shading analysis. Students apply these principles later in the course to a design project. The latter part of the course also provides a survey of broader building science topics including mechanical system design, microclimate, and current developments in energy-efficient design.

Current practice segregates these three areas by assigning separate and rigid roles to 1) an engineer, 2) a contractor, and 3) an architect. The goal of this class is to blur these traditional boundaries and erase the intellectual cleft though hands-on experience. Students are given weekly assignments which focus on one or more of the three areas. They may be asked to analyze a structure, to construct something from actual materials, or research a case study and present it to the class. Each assignment to geared to help students integrate construction and structural issues into their architectural design, so that they can maintain control of the entire design process.

The course will cover four material groups commonly used in two areas of the building assembly (structure and envelope): wood, concrete, steel, and glass. You will understand choices available and how materials are conventionally used. By observing construction, you'll see how our decisions affect the size of materials, connections, and where they are assembled. Architects must understand not only conventions, but also the potential in materials, so we will also study unusual and new developments.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This course examines developments in design, theory, graphic representation, construction technology, and interior programming through case studies of individual buildings. Our survey technique will be highly focused rather than panoptic. Each lecture will delve deeply into one or two buildings to examine program, spatial organization, graphic representation, critical building details, construction technology, and the relationship of the case study building with regard to other contemporary structures and the architect's overall body of work. From this nucleus, we will spiral outward to consider how the case study is embedded within a constellation of social and economic factors crucial to its design and physical realization. This survey of &quot;modernism's built discourses&quot; provides multiple perspectives on the variety of architectural propositions advanced to express the nature of modernity as a way of life.

Not only did they alter the socio-economic and political landscape on which architecture and urban planning depend, but they also led to technological innovations and vital debates about the built environment. This course examines the 1930's and 1940's topically, studying the work of the New Deal, corporate responses to the Depression and war, the important connections between architecture and advertising, the role of the Museum of Modern Art in the promotion of Modernism, the concept of the ideal house, and key tests, theories, and projects from the period.

Class readings and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity, and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents of architectural culture.

Using a variety of case studies drawn from different media (architectural theory, film, advertisements, architectural projects, and so on) and periods (turn of the century, the Modern Movement, Depression, World War II, 1960's, etc,) it provides a sampling of possibilities and models for the final student project, an in-depth, original research paper. Several themes thread their way through the course, including the role of the &quot;unbuilt&quot; in architectural practice; the uses of the future in the construction of national and personal identities, cultural narratives, and modern mythologies; and the importance of the future as cliche, and the role of play in cultural production.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This seminar prepares students to evaluate and design environments from the point of view of how they interact with the human body. Tools and clothing modify that interaction. Semi-fixed features of the near environment, especially furniture, may have greater impact on physical well being and social-psychological comfort than fixed features like walls, openings, and volume. Today, designers can help redefine and legitimize new attitudes toward supporting the human body by, for example, designing for a wide range of postural alternatives and possibly designing new kinds of furniture. At the urban design scale, the senses of proprioception and kinesthetics can be used to shape architecture and landscape architecture. This course covers these topics with special emphasis on chair design and evaluation. The public health implications of a new attitude toward posture and back support are explored. The course heightens students' consciousness of their own and others' physical perceptions through weekly experiential exercises. Students produce three design exercises: shoe, chair, and a room interior.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This seminar aims to explore how the physical and conceptual understanding of landscape can enrich current forms of architectural and urban design practice. At the junction of landform, infrastructure, urban design, and architecture lies a rich field of possibilities that is increasingly superseding the narrower field of each of the disciplines by themselves. In the past century, contemporary culture and technology-automobiles, televisions, cell phones, and the internet have socially, culturally, environmentally, and physically reshaped the urban fabric, calling into question the very definition of urbanity. The course will explore the implications for public space in an era of increased security and risk mitigation and how designers may direct the various invisible forces which give form to the world around us.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Taste is at work in the way we display our things as much as in the qualities of things themselves. A performance-oriented model of taste observes that objects fall into two broad categories: pragmatic (that support behavior) and symbolic (that identify a person). People visually organize these two categories of objects using both explicit and subconscious aesthetic rules to produce visually unified displays. Depending on how it is used, how it is placed in relation to other things, an object's meaning can vary. The display of taste is where objects take on--and shed--meanings, depending on how they are combined with one another. This seminar reviews the extensive body of 20th-century theory and empirical research on taste and considers the implications of theories about taste for design creation, design education, and for client-professional relations.

The social and spatial changes connected to the global economic restructuring of the last four decades are explored in relation to distinctive national conditions and their connection to historical forces such as colonization and imperialism. Theoretical arguments about international urban political economy, uneven development, deindustrialization and the growth of tourism and service industries, are grounded in specific urban and architectural contexts. Case studies explore issues such as urban entrepreneurialism and the branding of cities and nation-states; heritage practices and the postcolonial politics of place; border cities, and the urbanism of transnational production; cities, terrorism and the global architecture of security; critical regionalism, localism and other responses to debates on place and placelessness. Readings and class discussions examine course themes in a comparative framework and consider their implications for architectural design, education and professional practice.

Readings include key essays from the disciplines of philosophy, geography, architecture, landscape, and urbanism, and short works of fiction that illustrate and elucidate the spatial concepts. The readings are grouped according to themes that form the foundation for weekly seminar discussions. Chronological and thematic readings reveal the force of history upon the conceptualization of space, and its contradictions.

The seminar poses the following questions: What is the role of technology in the design philosophy of the architect and how is this theoretical position established in the architect's writings, lectures, interviews? How is this position revealed through the work moves to the developing world? How is this position negotiated in the design and construction of an individual building? Is this a successful strategy for achieving technical performance? Is this a successful strategy for achieving a coherent theoretical statement? A series of lectures explores these questions in relation to the architect and a set of required readings introduces the work of the architect and explores the relationship between technology and design philosophy. Students choose one building to investigate in parallel with the methods and issues discussed in class. These studies are presented in class as completed and assembled for submission as a final project.

The seminar applies a collection of measurement techniques, often involving novel approaches, to reveal operating patterns in the complex environment of contemporary buildings. The personal experience students gain in performing the evaluations contributes to the students' experiential base at a formative time. Analysis of data collected in the field and the comparison of these data to values given by simulation tools provides a foundation for understanding the more abstract tools and standards used by designers in practice. The juxtaposition of design intention and post-occupancy performance can be a powerful learning experience now, as well as preparation for evaluating building performance in the future.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This seminar introduces theories, technologies, design strategies and analytical methods of architectural daylighting, including issues of visual experience, integration with electrical lighting and energy use. The course provides foundation for intelligent daylighting design by developing frameworks for thinking about design, performance and tools. The work examines two archetypal daylighting conditions: a toplighted (roof-lighted) space and a side-lighted (window-lit) space with range of methods including readings, on-site observation and measurement, case studies, design exercises and analysis through models and simulation. This is a graduate seminar: attendance, pin-ups, readings and engaged participation are required each week.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">In profound buildings, the structural system, construction materials, and architectural form work together to create an integrated work of art. Current practice segregates these three areas by assigning separate and rigid roles to 1) an engineer, 2) a contractor, and 3) an architect. The goal of this class is to blur these traditional boundaries and erase the intellectual cleft through hands-on experience. Students are given weekly assignments which focus on one or more of the three areas. They may be asked to analyze a structure, to construct something from actual materials or research a case study and present it to the class. Each assignment is geared to help students integrate construction and structural issues into their architectural design so that they can maintain control of the entire design process.

A central goal of the course is to help students understand structural issues as they relate to design and to help them become comfortable with structural concepts so that they can begin to integrate the structure and architecture. The course can be taken for 1 unit, 2 units, or 3 units depending on the amount of time a student wishes to commit to it. A final report showing the evolution of each student's project with clear reference to how structural understanding influenced design decisions is required of all students regardless of units taken. Enrollment strictly limited to 10 students.

Our survey technique will be highly focused rather than panoptic. Each lecture will delve deeply into one or two buildings to examine program, spatial organization, graphic representation, critical building details, construction technology, and the relationship of the case study building with regard to other contemporary structures and the &quot;architect's overall body of work&quot;. From this nucleus, we will spiral outward to consider how the case study is embedded within a constellation of social and economic factors crucial to its design and physical realization. This survey of &quot;modernism's built discourses&quot; provides multiple perspectives on the variety of architectural propositions advanced to express the nature of modernity as a way of life.

Class readings, and discussions explore the post-World War II crisis within modernism, postmodernism within and beyond architectural culture, and more recent developments around issues such as rapid urbanization, sustainability, the politics of cultural identity and globalization. Transformations in architectural theory are examined in relation to historical forces such as the economy, the growth and transformation of cities, and the changing relationship between design professions and disciplines. The influences of digital media, new materials and production techniques on architectural education and practice are explored and the implications for architectural theory assessed. Key issues are anchored in case studies of buildings, urban spaces, and the institutions and agents or architectural culture.

<p class="noindent"><span class="label"><strong>Hours and format:</strong> </span>4 hours of seminar per week, including short lectures, meetings with the developer and owner of the land, studies and discussions of precedents, and reviews of student work with other members of the faculty and visitors. </p>

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This class is intended for first-time graduate student instructors, especially those working in studio and lab settings. The class covers a range of issues that normally come up when teaching, offers suggestions regarding how to work well with other graduate student instructors and faculty, and how to manage a graduate student instructor's role as both student and teacher. The greatest benefit of this class comes from the opportunity to explore important topics together. Using a relatively light, but provocative set of readings, the seminar will explore the issues raised each week. There will be one assignment intended to help students explore their own expectations as educators.
