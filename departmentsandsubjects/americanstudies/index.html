<h4><br/>
<strong>Group Major in American Studies</strong></h4>




<p>American Studies is an individualized interdisciplinary major that offers undergraduates a unique opportunity to take advantage of the depth and breadth of Americanist scholarship and research on the campus in order to explore and understand the United States and its place in the globalizing world.  American Studies courses integrate a variety of subjects, methods, and materials from many academic disciplines, including the traditional blend of history and literature, as well as the social sciences, material culture, the built environment, law, technology, urbanism, ecology, economy, and the arts.</p>




<p><strong>Prerequisites to the Major:</strong> In order to declare the major, students with less than 60 units must complete American Studies 10 and one other Lower Division Requirement.  Students beyond 60 units must be enrolled in AS 10 and speak with a faculty advisor before being allowed to declare.</p>




<p><strong>Lower Division Requirements: </strong>Students are required to take four lower-division courses relevant to the major.  One of the four is American Studies 10, Introduction to American Studies (4 units).  The other three may be chosen from among courses that focus on the culture and history of the United States, with no more than two courses from any one department.  A minimum grade of &quot;C&quot; is required in all lower division courses taken for the major. For further information about particular courses that satisfy the lower division requirements, please contact the American Studies student academic advisor.</p>




<p><strong>Upper Division Requirements:</strong> 30-36 units distributed among the following:</p>




<ol>
	<li><em>Core Methods Courses.</em> (6-8 units) Students are required to take one course each from the two methods series, &quot;Examining US Cultures in Time&quot; and &quot;Examining US Cultures in Place.&quot; See department listings for available courses every semester.</li>
	<li><em>Area of Concentration.</em> At least 20 units of upper division coursework drawn from the College of Letters and Science and the professional schools and colleges, in the student's individually articulated area of concentration. Areas of concentration may be highly individualized, depending on the student's intellectual focus, prior preparation, and the availability of courses. Therefore, students planning to declare the major should meet with a faculty advisor early in their junior year, at the latest, to plan their upper division program. Subsequently, this program can be revised only with the approval of the faculty advisor.</li>
	<li><em>Thesis Requirement.</em> All majors are required to enroll in an American Studies senior thesis seminar (4 units) in which they write a substantial research paper.</li>
	<li><em>Historical Requirement.</em> One of the courses taken to complete the American Studies major (either upper or lower division) must focus on US history, culture, and/or politics before 1900. Students should check with an American Studies student academic advisor to ensure that the course they take meets this requirement.</li>
</ol>




<a name="honorsprogram"></a>
<h4><strong>Honors Program</strong></h4>




<p>Students who wish to be eligible to graduate with honors must enroll in the honors thesis seminar, American Studies H195. For admission to H195, students must have senior standing, an overall GPA of 3.51, and a GPA of 3.65 in the major.</p>




<p>For further information, please contact the student academic advisor at 231 Evans Hall, (510) 642-9320, or <a href="mailto:amerstd@berkeley.edu">amerstd@berkeley.edu</a>

This course examines the 1930's and 1940's topically, studying the work of the New Deal, corporate responses to the Depression and war, the important connections between architecture and advertising, the role of the Museum of Modern Art in the promotion of Modernism, the concept of the ideal house, and key tests, theories, and projects from the period.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This course considers how the American detective is represented in fiction, fil, and popular culture. We will examine how representations of the American detective are affected by diverse historican and socio-cultural factors, including the ideology of American individualism, paradigms of investigation and ordered knowledge, and competing discourses of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. After a brief consideration of early American detectives and detectives in the classic American hardboiled tradition, we will focus on many detectives from traditionally understudied groups, including female detectives, African American detectives, Chicana detectives, Asian American detectives, Native American detectives, and gay and lesbian detectives. This course may be used as an elective in the American Studies major.

We will study the nature and extent of this motif in recent American culture (including its expression in literature, music, and popular idioms) as well as situate our discussions within the context of historical expressions of the American journey as cyclical, eschatological, or as a journey to oblivion. Drawing on selections from, among others, Walt Whitman, Josiah Royce, James Baldwin, Jack Kerouac, and Maya Angelou, we will discuss the notion of journey in terms of possibility, nostalgia, nectar, cynicism, self-deception, and disappointment. Students will be encouraged to consider--and write about--their own relation to this expressive tradition in American cultural history.

This course aims to go against and beyond the gilded facade and exotic mystery of San Francisco's leading tourist attraction by taking an inside look at the history and culture of a complex community constantly in flux. We will review the socioeconomic and political conditions that shaped the formation and development of San Francisco's Chinatown and the lives of its people from the community's beginnings in the 1850's to the present day. In the process, we will also examine how distinct social institutions and Chinatown culture developed in response to life in America, particularly to immigration policies, the anti-Chinese movement, acculturation and assimilation forces, new gender roles and relationships, and U.S.-China politics. There will be an opportunity to learn about San Francisco Chinatown first-hand as the instructor, who is a native of that community, will take the class on a field trip.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Westward expansion and the frontier experience have long assumed a mythical status as formative events in the annals of American culture, providing Americans with a collective cultural history and space for fantasy. Within this story there has been little room for women: westward expansion has been encoded as a male activity, and the American West has served a proving ground for the definition of American manhood. However, recent research on frontier women's history has shown that white and non-white women were present on all frontiers and in all phases of American expansion to the West. Moreover, white, literate women wrote copiously in, on, and about western frontiers--in letters and diaries, travel and settlement narratives, reminiscences and autobiographies, poems, stories, and novels. Reading from a diversity of women's texts, we will explore gender together with race and class in order to understand the women's frontier. This course will roughly follow a chronological line from the 1830s into the first decades of the 20th century.

After Columbus, they were applied to people of the Americas who were thus turned into objects of fear and desire. While these images were modified over the centuries, basic elements of positive, and negative stereotyping connected with notions of race, gender, and environmental conditioning have persisted to the present day. This class will study a selection of European and North American literary texts from the late 18th century to the present, focusing on the discourse of culture, alterity, and identity as well as, on such aspects as the Romantic idealization of &quot;natural man,&quot; savagism, natural nobility, communicational boundaries, and forms of cultural hybridity.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">American society is fragmented, divided, and often polarized. Race, class, and at times culture serve as boundaries which separate and reinforce distinctions, creating many different Americas within the U.S. How one sees America tends to be intimately related to the environment in which one lives, the social status and class one occupies, and the historical experience of the individual or the group with which one identifies. Yet, there are also forces which bind Americans together and which have produced a culture that transcends various forms of difference to create a common American identity. This course will explore the nature of those forces that divide and unite the peoples of the U.S. Through literature, film, and social science, we will attempt to identify the ingredients of the glue that holds this society together and gives the concept of America meaning.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Film scholar Frank McConell wrote, &quot;Each era chooses the monster it deserves and projects,&quot; which is to say that sources of fright are not universal but contingent, culturally and temporally specific. This course will study the changing face of horror in the U.S., from the nineteenth century to the present. Students will begin with Freud's theory of the uncanny - a model which will inform our examinations of various monsters depicted in literature, cinema, television, graphic fiction, and music.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This course is designed to encourage research skills, critical thinking, and effective writing. An intensive reading and research seminar, the course will assist students in the development of skills fundamental to advanced research in the humanities, social sciences, and cultural studies. In addition to examining some topics in current American studies scholarship, students will conduct semester-long research projects. The effort entails identification of research topics, cultivation of interdisciplinary methodologies, compilation of annotated bibliographies, and completion of a literature review, which may serve as the first portion of the American studies senior thesis. The course is strongly recommended for those who have been out of touch with the conventions of academic research and writing or who might wish to pursue a graduate degree in the future.
