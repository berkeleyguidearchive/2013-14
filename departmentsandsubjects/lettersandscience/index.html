<a name="overview"></a>
<h4><br/>
Overview</h4>




<p>The College of Letters and Science offers undergraduate students a variety of programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree in four academic years of full-time study. The first two years are a time of exploration and experimentation, leading to declaration of a major. In the last two years students acquire and refine special knowledge as they focus on their major programs. The college’s departments are devoted to instruction and research in a variety of academic subjects. Each department represents a style of study and communication and refined development of a set of structured ideas. The subjects of the departments overlap and complement one another.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="requirementsforadmissioninadvancedstanding"></a>
<h4>Requirements for Admission in Advanced Standing</h4>




<p>Students applying for admission will not be considered if they have completed more than 80 semester (120 quarter) units. The dean of the college makes exceptions to this policy only in unusual circumstances. Applicants with advanced-placement credit may, however, exceed the 80-semester-unit limitation by the amount of their advanced-placement credit and be admissible if they meet all other admission criteria.</p>




<p>Transfer students with 60 or more semester units are expected to have satisfied, before admission to the college, the reading and composition breadth requirement, the foreign language breadth requirement, and the quantitative reasoning breadth requirement of the college. Students who apply as intercampus transfers and who have completed all the Letters and Science breadth requirements, or the general education requirements, or the equivalent of either, at the University of California campus from which they transfer may, upon petition, be credited with having completed the breadth requirements of the college. Transfer students who apply from community colleges in California have the option of fulfilling lower division breadth requirements by completing the <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/requirements/additional-requirements/igetc/" target="_blank">Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC)</a>
. This program specifies a series of subject areas and types of courses that, if completed before transfer, will satisfy the lower division breadth and general education requirements at any general campus of the University of California.</p>





<p><em>Note:</em> In recent years, certain major programs have turned away qualified applicants because of space limitations. Transfer applicants should be aware that admission to those majors in the college is competitive.</p>




<h5>Biological Sciences Majors</h5>




<p>Students planning to declare majors in a biological science must in addition have completed the minimum subject preparation in the major with a GPA of 2.0 (C average) or higher. The subject preparation listed below is minimal; transfer students who wish to declare a major in a biological science are urged to consult directly with the department or program in which they are interested to learn of additional requirements or of any restriction placed on entry to the major. The subject preparation for majors in the biological sciences is as follows:</p>




<p>Students who have completed 60 to 70 semester units:</p>




<ol>
	<li>General chemistry with laboratory (equivalent to one year of UC Berkeley's inorganic chemistry with laboratory)</li>
	<li>General biology with laboratory (equivalent to Berkeley's Biology 1A-1B)</li>
</ol>




<p>Students who have completed 71 to 80 semester units must complete in addition to points 1 and 2 above: Introductory organic chemistry with laboratory (equivalent to Berkeley's organic chemistry with laboratory).</p>




<hr/>




<a name="requirementsforthebachelorofartsdegree"></a>
<h4>Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts Degree</h4>




<p>Students must complete a minimum of 120 semester units, distributed according to regulations that appear in the College of Letters and Science's <em>Guide to Earning Your Degree.</em> A 15-unit class schedule per semester is considered to be a normal course load; a class list of fewer than 13 units requires the special permission of the dean. There are also scholarship, minimum-progress, residence, breadth, and major requirements; these are described in the announcement as well. Brief descriptions of the breadth, major, and minor requirements appear below. Major and minor programs are outlined under the department, field, or group headings in this bulletin. In addition, students must satisfy the University requirements in Subject A, American History, and American Institutions, and the Berkeley campus American Cultures requirement.</p>




<h5>Breadth Requirements</h5>




<p>There are four breadth requirements:</p>




<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Reading and Composition:</strong> Students must normally complete the first half of the requirement (an “A” course) during the freshman year and the second half of the requirement (a “B” course) during the sophomore year. Students must complete the requirement through coursework according to the requirements of the semester system, whether the coursework is undertaken at Berkeley or elsewhere.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Quantitative Reasoning:</strong> This requirement may be fulfilled by satisfactory performance in an examination or by successful completion of an acceptable college course. Information about acceptable examinations and acceptable courses is included in the announcement. This requirement, if satisfied by coursework, must be completed without delay.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Foreign Language:</strong> Students who have not satisfied the language requirement at the time of admission must complete it without delay. The requirement may be satisfied by (a) completion of the third year of one foreign language in high school with a minimum grade of C-, (b) by completion of the second semester of a Berkeley course, or its equivalent elsewhere, in one foreign language with a minimum grade of C-, or (c) by demonstration of equivalent knowledge through examination, including the College Entrance Examination Board Achievement Test, the CEEB Advanced Placement Examination (if taken before admission to the college), or an acceptable foreign language placement examination offered by a foreign language department at Berkeley or on another campus of the University of California.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Seven-Course Breadth Requirement:</strong> Students must take one course from each of the following categories, with no more than two courses in the same department:</p>
	</li>
</ol>




<ul style="margin-left:120px">
	<li>One course in Physical Science</li>
	<li>One course in Biological Science</li>
	<li>One course in Arts and Literature</li>
	<li>One course in Historical Studies</li>
	<li>One course in Philosophy and Values</li>
	<li>One course in International Studies or participation in the University of California Education Abroad Program or a recognized equivalent</li>
	<li>One course in Social and Behavioral Sciences</li>
</ul>




<p>These courses may be taken from the College of Letters and Science and the professional schools and colleges and may be spread over the four years of college attendance. See the College of Letters and Science's <em>Guide to Earning Your Degree</em> for details and a list of the approved courses that you may take to fulfill the requirement.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="majorprograms"></a>
<h4>Major Programs</h4>




<p>All students must pursue and complete a major program, the object of which is to provide them with a limited experience in specialization. There are more than 60 departmental major programs ranging from the humanities (e.g., art, comparative literature, English, foreign languages, etc.) and the social sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, geography, psychology, etc.), to the biological sciences (e.g., integrative biology, molecular and cell biology) and the physical sciences (e.g., geology, mathematics, statistics, etc.). In addition, there are group majors in American Studies, Asian Studies, Celtic Studies, Cognitive Science, Development Studies, Dutch Studies, Environmental Sciences, Ethnic Studies, Film, Latin American Studies, Legal Studies, Media Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, Peace and Conflict Studies, Political Economy, Religious Studies, and Social Welfare. There are also field majors in the Physical Sciences and Interdisciplinary Studies. Moreover, students who have completed at least 60 semester units and at least one semester of enrollment at Berkeley, and who have attained a minimum 3.0 Berkeley and overall GPA may, with the permission of the dean and support and supervision of a college faculty member and a faculty member who acts as second reader of the individual major thesis, pursue an individual major designed to satisfy special academic goals. Thus, the options available to students outside traditional disciplines are many and varied.</p>




<p>For a list of all majors available in the College of Letters and Science, please see the <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/majorlist.html" target="_blank">List of Majors Page on the college's website</a>
.</p>





<hr/>




<a name="minorprograms"></a>
<h4>Minor Programs</h4>




<p>Minor programs are intended as optional programs that will encourage coherence in the work that students undertake outside their major field(s) of study. Students may complete one or more minor programs, normally in a field both academically and administratively distinct from their major. The college has set the following minimum requirements for completion of a minor program:</p>




<ol>
	<li><strong>Course Requirements:</strong> A minimum of five upper division courses, completed on a letter-graded basis, are required for the minor. At least three of the five upper division courses must be completed at Berkeley.</li>
	<li><strong>GPA Requirements:</strong> Students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 in upper division courses required for the minor program.</li>
</ol>




<p>Students should consult the department or group in charge of the minor for additional requirements and specific information regarding the minor program in which they are interested. Admission to the minor and certification of completion of the minor are determined by the department or group in charge of the program. When a student completes a minor program, the department or group in charge will notify the Office of the Registrar, so that the completion may be noted on the student’s transcript.</p>




<p>Additional minor programs are offered by other schools and colleges on campus. Consult their listings in this bulletin for more information. For a list of minors available in the College of Letters and Science, please see the <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/minorlist.html" target="_blank">List of Minors page on the college's website</a>
.</p>





<hr/>




<a name="undergraduatedivision"></a>
<h4>Undergraduate Division</h4>




<p>The mission of the Undergraduate Division is to develop and administer innovative and interdisciplinary courses and programs in the College of Letters and Science that do not belong to a single department.</p>




<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="/archive/2013-14/departmentsandsubjects/undergraduateandinterdisciplinarystudies" target="_blank">Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS)</a>
 </strong>
administers the <a href="/archive/2013-14/departmentsandsubjects/interdisciplinarystudies/" target="_blank">field major in interdisciplinary studies</a>
 and the group majors in <a href="/archive/2013-14/departmentsandsubjects/americanstudies/" target="_blank">American Studies</a>

, and P<a href="/archive/2013-14/departmentsandsubjects/politicaleconomy/" target="_blank">olitical Economy</a>
.</li>

</ul>





<p>In addition to our interdisciplinary majors, the Undergraduate Division sponsors a wide range of academic programs and services for undergraduates. A world-class research university such as ours offers something special to undergraduates who know how to make the most of it, and the Undergraduate Division is a good starting place for students who seek close intellectual contact with faculty, either in a small seminar or in a research apprenticeship, for students who would like to apply for a national scholarship, etc. Some of the campuswide programs for undergraduates that are administered by the Undergraduate Division are described below.</p>




<ul>
	<li><strong>The <a href="/archive/2013-14/departmentsandsubjects/collegewritingprograms/" target="_blank">College Writing Programs</a>
</strong>
 (112 Wheeler Hall, (510) 642-5570), designed to help undergraduates establish fluency and control over their reading and writing skills, are also part of the Undergraduate Division.</li>

	<li><strong>The <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a>
 </strong>
are also housed in the Undergraduate Division. Seminars are created and taught by faculty members from nearly every campus department. The office posts descriptions of these special course offerings to freshmen in time for Tele-BEARS registration each semester. For more information, please contact Alix Schwartz in 333 Campbell Hall, (510) 642-8378, or go see the <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars website</a>
.</li>

	<li><strong>The<a href="http://ucdc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"> UC Berkeley Washington Program</a>
,</strong>
 also administered by UGIS, allows undergraduates to spend a semester in Washington, DC, combining coursework with internships.</li>

	<li><strong>The <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR)</a>
</strong>
 seeks to involve undergraduates more deeply in the research life of the University. To this end, OUR coordinates and develops programs and resources that bring undergraduates into the field, laboratories, and archives. This office administers the Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program, the Haas Scholars Program, and the Beckman Scholars Program, and maintains a central <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">research opportunities website</a>
.</li>

	<li><strong>The <a href="http://scholarships.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Scholarship Connection</a>
 </strong>
coordinates applications for scholarships and awards based on academic achievement and social or political contribution. Campus committees for the Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, and several other distinguished scholarships are housed here. Staff work to identify talented undergraduates and assist them in the application process.</li>

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">The approaches to problem solving developed by scientists have proven to be effective, and yet we as individuals, groups, and larger societies do not often seem to be able to take advantage even of rational approaches to problems--let alone the &quot;hyperrationality&quot; offered by science. Rationality by itself does not solve any problems or answer any questions. Its efficaciousness depends on how we combine it with our drives, goals, and desires--and perhaps our less-linear algorithm-based intuitions.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This is a Discovery Course for non-Biology majors designed to introduce lower-division college students to biology through the lens of the contemporary problems facing people, the planet and the species of the planet. Modern genetic contributions will be presented on such issues as genetic engineering of plants and animals, the emergence of new pathogens, the role of genetic variation among individuals, and the extent to which DNA is and isn’t destiny. Each week will close with the presentation and discussion of a defining biological challenge facing the world.

<p class="block noindent"><span class="label"><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> </span> The learning objectives will be, at one end, to understand what an experiment is, how is it controlled and what does one need to know about an experiment to be able to rely upon any conclusion. That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/>

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Each lower-division course in this series deals primarily with the human events, institutions and activities of the past. Historical Studies are particularly important because, to paraphrase the philosopher George Santayana, those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. The study of history provides us with perspective on the human condition and with an appreciation of the origins and evolution of the numerous cultures and social orders that have populated the earth. Whether students study history to understand how our world evolved from the past or to focus on the distinctions between the present and previous eras, they will come away with a richer understanding of and appreciation for human experience.

Students fulfilling Physical Science breadth in the College of Letters &amp; Science may be motivated by the pure pleasure of penetrating the mysteries of the universe, or by more practical considerations such as a desire to take an intelligent stance on such topics as greenhouse gases and space exploration. Whether students opt for the practical or the theoretical or a combination of both, students choosing a lower-division course in this series will learn to formulate problems clearly and think quantitatively, critically, and abstractly.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Physical scientists seek to understand the universe, from its microscopic substructure to its largest structures, from our own earth to the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. Students fulfilling Physical Science breadth in the College of Letters &amp; Science may be motivated by the pure pleasure of penetrating the mysteries of the universe, or by more practical considerations such as a desire to take an intelligent stance on such topics as greenhouse gases and space exploration. Whether students opt for the practical or the theoretical or a combination of both, students choosing a lower-division course in this series will learn to formulate problems clearly and think quantitatively, critically, and abstractly.

What is a formal analysis vs. a critical interpretation of an art work? How do curators approach art? Are we supposed to ‘learn from’ an art work or ‘experience’ it or have some particular ‘relationship’ to it? Is art a matter of conveying feeling, a message, or an encounter with beauty?

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Twenty-five years ago the Dalai Lama suggested that a dialogue between Buddhist practitioners and Western scientists interested in the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the world might lead to new ideas and be of benefit to both communities. While science and religion are not generally considered to be natural collaborators, the dialogue that ensued quickly gained momentum and catalyzed new strands of research, most notably in the area of the neuroscience of meditation and emotion. We will continue this dialogue, first by laying the necessary groundwork in our respective fields, and then by exploring areas of convergence and divergence around certain themes.

The study of history provides us with perspective on the human condition and with an appreciation of the origins and evolution of the numerous cultures and social orders that have populated the earth. Whether students study history to understand how our world evolved from the past or to focus on the distinctions between the present and previous eras, they will come away with a richer understanding of and appreciation for human experience.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Each upper-division course in this series deals primarily with the human events, institutions and activities of the past. Historical Studies are particularly important because, to paraphrase the philosopher George Santayana, those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. The study of history provides us with perspective on the human condition and with an appreciation of the origins and evolution of the numerous cultures and social orders that have populated the earth. Whether students study history to understand how our world evolved from the past or to focus on the distinctions between the present and previous eras, they will come away with a richer understanding of and appreciation for human experience.

With these different perspectives as a framework, the course will then turn to treatments of happiness in the behavioral sciences, evolutionary scholarship, and neuroscience. Special emphasis will be given to understanding how happiness arises in experiences of the moral emotions, including gratitude, compassion, reverence and awe, as well as aesthetic emotions like humor and beauty.
