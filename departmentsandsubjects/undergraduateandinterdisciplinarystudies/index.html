<h4><br/>
Overview</h4>




<p>Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS) in the Undergraduate Division of the College of Letters and Science serves as a center for innovations in undergraduate education that extend beyond traditional departmental boundaries. Our major and minor programs attract undergraduates who wish to explore the most intellectually engaging and promising interdisciplinary fields under the direction of scholars who are pioneers in charting these new areas and methods of inquiry. UGIS has been, and continues to be, an incubator for new ideas, including experimental programs and courses, as well as curricula designed to promote the ideals of a liberal arts education. We are especially dedicated to creating programs such as the Freshman and Sophomore Seminar Program and the Undergraduate Research Program that nurture productive intellectual relationships between faculty members and students.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="fieldmajor"></a>
<h4>Field Major</h4>




<h5>Interdisciplinary Studies</h5>




<p>The ISF major affords undergraduates a thoroughly interdisciplinary framework for their studies. The program allows students to establish individualized areas of concentration using courses in the humanities, the social sciences, and/or the professional schools and colleges.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="groupmajors"></a>
<h4>Group Majors</h4>




<h5>American Studies</h5>




<p>This group major offers students the opportunity to study American society using a broad range of methods drawn from a variety of disciplines in the College of Letters and Science and the professional schools and colleges. American Studies courses will attempt to take into account how the cultures of America have been continually reshaped by movements of people, commerce, and ideas crossing borders. The major draws on faculty resources and research in literature, history, economics, architecture, material culture, media studies, ethnic studies, and urban and regional studies.</p>




<h5>Cognitive Science</h5>




<p>This group major is the cross-disciplinary study of the structure and processes of human cognition and their computational simulation or modeling. This interdisciplinary program has been designed to give students an understanding of questions dealing with human cognition, such as concept formation, visual perception, the acquisition and processing of natural language, and human reasoning and problem solving. The program draws on relevant courses found within the fields of biology, computer science, education, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology, as well as specially designed lower and upper division courses in cognitive science.</p>




<h5>International and Area Studies</h5>




<p>The International and Area Studies office (101 Stephens Hall, (510) 642-4466) administers group majors in Asian Studies, Development Studies, Latin American Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, Peace and Conflict Studies (PACS), and Political Economy. For information about those group majors, see the individual program listing.</p>




<h5>Media Studies</h5>




<p>The major applies a range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities to the understanding of contemporary mass media and their structure, history, content, consequences, and policy implications.</p>




<h5>Religious Studies</h5>




<p>The major provides opportunities for securing a broad background in the liberal arts while at the same time allowing for a focus on a thematic concern or a particular religious tradition. The major views religion from a global perspective and combines aspects of the humanities and social sciences. A Religious Studies minor is also available.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="minorprograms"></a>
<h4>Minor Programs</h4>




<h5>Applied Language Studies Minor</h5>




<p>Sometimes called Applied Linguistics, the field of Applied Language Studies is devoted to the study of particular domains of language learning and use, such as foreign language learning and teaching, bi- and multi-lingualism, translation and interpretation, communication in professional contexts, or intercultural communication.</p>




<h5>Creative Writing Minor</h5>




<p>Students earn a minor in Creative Writing by completing three upper division creative writing courses and two upper division literature courses. Students may choose among a wide variety of courses from numerous departments. The Creative Writing minor is housed in the Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies, 231 Evans Hall. A student handbook outlining minor requirements in detail is available at the minor office. For more information, call (510) 642-2363 or visit the <a href="http://learning.berkeley.edu/creative" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>





<h5>Disability Studies Minor</h5>




<p>The Disability Studies minor explores how to best meet the challenges and alleviate the problems of those with impairments or disabilities, with emphasis on the role of those affected in defining problems and evaluating solutions. The minor requirements consist of two core courses and three approved upper division electives chosen from a wide variety of courses from numerous departments. The Disability Studies minor is housed in the Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies, 231 Evans Hall. A student handbook outlining minor requirements in detail is available at the minor office. For more information, call (510) 643-7691 or visit the <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/ugis/ds" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>





<h5>Human Rights Interdisciplinary Minor</h5>




<p>This minor offers a teaching program specifically focused on human rights but open to myriad disciplinary approaches and welcomes students from many corners of campus. It allows students to shape their education around coursework that investigates the legal, political, historical, economic, social, psychological, and representational dynamics of human rights. Helping undergraduates explore issues via multiple forms of thought and media of expression—through literature as well as politics, journalism as well as law, film as well as anthropology—the IHR minor emphasizes the many different intellectual spaces in which human rights questions are currently being posed. For more information, call (510) 643-7691 or visit the <a href="http://hri.ugis.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>

<a name="otherprograms"></a>
<h4>Other Programs</h4>




<p>In addition to the majors listed above, the Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies oversees a suite of academic enrichment programs:</p>




<p><strong>The Big Ideas Courses</strong>, launched in 2012, brings together two or more faculty members from different disciplines to co-teach innovative breadth courses. Big Ideas Courses take up key intellectual and societal challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by the perspective or methodology of one discipline alone. For more information, call (510) 642-8378 or visit the <a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>





<p><strong>The College Writing Programs</strong> (112 Wheeler Hall, (510) 642-5570), designed to help undergraduates establish fluency and control over their reading and writing skills, is also in the Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>




<p><strong>Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</strong> arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 (and in some cases 90) bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students, and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores. Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley's large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. As you browse through this <em>Bulletin,</em> you will find lower division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments as well as by the professional schools and colleges.</p>




<p>Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found in time for Tele-BEARS registration on the <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">program's website</a>
 that also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates. For additional information regarding the Freshman and Sophomore Seminars, contact the program office at 231 Evans Hall, (510) 642-8378.</p>





<p><strong>Letters and Science Discovery Courses: </strong>Students in the College of Letters and Science are asked to fulfill seven breadth requirements. The Letters and Science Discovery Courses are exemplary breadth courses, designed to engage and broaden the minds of non-experts. Taught by some of the most distinguished faculty members on campus, the L&amp;S Discovery Courses are guaranteed to deliver a high-quality educational experience. For more information, including the current list of courses and the breadth requirements they fulfill, visit the <a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>





<p><strong>On the Same Page </strong>is a campus-wide book-in-common program, designed to welcome new freshmen and transfer students into the intellectual dialogue that characterizes the Berkeley campus. Each year all of the faculty and all new students receive a book (or film or other study object) that provides the focus for discussions, courses, events and activities in the fall term. For more information, call (510) 642-8378 or visit the <a href="http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>

The course is for students with and without disabilities, and may be of special interest to students preparing for careers in the health professions, education, law, architecture, social work, or gerontology.

Through real stories of women's lives which reached the media in the last decade and before, students will move toward a dynamic understanding of the impact of a range of physical, emotional, and mental disabilities in the context of current social forces and public policy. We will explore historic perspectives as well as current trends in medicine, independent living, care-giving, insurance, public benefits, law, and community activism as they affect and are affected by disabled women and girls and their families. We will discuss controversial ethical issues such as prenatal screening, wrongful birth law suits, and physician-assisted suicide. Course readings will draw on the rich literature of disabled women's anthologies, biography and autobiograhpy, scholarly and popular literature of disability, feminist analyses, creative writing, women's art, film, and theatre.

Whether it was Roosevelt declaring war on the Japanese or Regan declaring war on government bureaucracy, they, like all presidents, understood the power of their words to make history and to change it. This course will study the history of the presidency through their speeches. We will read and analyze remarks delivered from the podium in economic booms and busts, in times of social unrest, and even in moments of humor. By reading others and drafting our own, we will also learn the elements of an effective speech and how to craft and deliver one. A few former and current presidential speechwriters will be featured as guests throughout the semester. Course requirements include the 750-word op-ed, preparation and delivery of a 10-minute speech, writing a mid-term paper based on course materials and sitting for a final exam.

Many observers see the politics of the Copenhagen Accord as a glimpse into the new world order in which international diplomatic power will increasingly be shared by the United States (U.S.) and emerging powers, such as China. Climate change policy also offers a lens through which the U.S. domestic environmental policymaking process can be viewed and its evolution better understood. This course will examine the dynamics of global environmental treaty-making after first studying the development of U.S. environmental protection efforts. Students will then analyze the international and domestic efforts that led up to the Copenhagen Accord and assess what is needed and likely to result from the next UNFCCC meeting to be held in Mexico City in 2010.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This class will teach you how to better understand the fundamental factors that drive elections in America and to learn some of the skills employed by political professionals. Many of your assignments will require you to apply the lessons of this class to real time events. Our goal in this class is to go beyond the spin and hyperbole of many election commentators and understand how voters decide and how strategists persuade.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This course explores museums as dynamic sites of intellectual and cultural debate, and as institutions vested with the authority to define aesthetics, history, heritage, and even citizenship. Now more than ever, as the process of globalization raises questions about the fluidity, preservation, and &quot;authenticity&quot; of culture, museums of all kinds are attracting great interest both as places to visit and as a subject of critical analysis in their own right. As places defined by the collection, display, and interpretation of objects, museums are bound up in questions of permanence and transience, difference and identity, equity and privilege--issues that lie at the heart of what is termed the &quot;new museology.&quot; But as institutional repositories of community memory or indigenous knowledge, they are also bound up in questions of representation, access and ownership--issues that move the debate over museum collections squarely into the politics of local, state, and national control over heritage. If ownership and control are the new realities of international heritage policy (and law), museums have quickly emerged as important sites on which and through which these claims are being made.
