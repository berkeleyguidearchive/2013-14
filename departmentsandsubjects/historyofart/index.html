<h4><br/>
<strong>Major Requirements</strong></h4>




<p>The major offers an introduction to the history of the visual arts in Western and Asian culture as well as the opportunity to do specialized study in areas of the student's choice. Fundamentally, a humanistic inquiry and often multi-disciplinary in approach, the field provides majors with essential training in those perceptual and historical, research and critical skills needed for many specialized professions. Majors frequently go on to careers in business, law, or the arts as well as graduate study in the history of art and careers in teaching, museum work, and conservation.</p>




<p>Majors in the History of Art select one of three areas of Emphasis: Western, Asian, or Independent Specialization. This tripartite organization underscores the Department’s commitment to multiple fields of scholarly inquiry and to thematic specialization, while addressing the cross-border, multi-cultural dimensions of the visual arts that cannot be adequately explored within a single culture.</p>




<p>Study in a given field or independent specialization builds from courses in common at the Lower Division level together with HA100: Methodology in Art History. Students then select Upper Division courses relevant to their field or independent specialization with distribution across three subfields of the discipline.</p>




<p><strong>For students in Western Art, the subfields are:</strong></p>




<ul>
	<li>Ancient (to ca. 400 C.E.)</li>
	<li>Medieval-Early Modern (ca. 400-1800 C.E.)</li>
	<li>Modern/Contemporary (after ca. 1800 C.E.)</li>
</ul>




<p><strong>For students in Asian Art, the subfields are:</strong></p>




<ul>
	<li>South/Southeast Asian</li>
	<li>Chinese</li>
	<li>Japanese</li>
</ul>




<p>For students in Asian Art or an Independent Specialization, two of these three courses must predate 1800 CE and one must postdate 1800.</p>




<p>Within the Western and Asian specializations, students should then develop an area or areas of special competence or focus (such as Ancient; Medieval; Renaissance; Baroque; Modern; Contemporary; or Indian; Southeast Asian; Chinese; Japanese; Korean; etc.) defined by a cluster of Upper Division History of Art courses and seminars within their field and a course outside the Department in a field relevant to their focus within it.</p>




<p>The course outside the department is integral to and foundational for the student's emphasis and specific focus; it often is a course in history, literature, philosophy, or religion. It may not be an instructional language course.  It requires the prior approval of an Undergraduate Adviser and should be taken as soon as the student’s focus is defined, not left until her/his final semester.  An Honors Thesis can serve as a capstone of a student’s work within her/his emphasis, and a student may integrate a major in History of Art with a second major.</p>




<h5>How and When to Declare the Major, Select an Emphasis</h5>




<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an undergraduate faculty adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters.  (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) </p>




<h5>Advantages of Declaring Early</h5>




<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>




<ol>
	<li>A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty</li>
	<li>Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters and Science (L &amp; S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the Honors Program</li>
	<li>Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities</li>
</ol>




<hr/>




<a name="advising"></a>
<h4>Advising</h4>




<p>Declared majors must see an Undergraduate Adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the Department website and in the Department office). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter holidays. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a>
</p>





<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (History of Art 193, 194, H195, C196W, 199), and some special programs.  Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>




<p>Each semester during the Tele-BEARS enrollment period every Art History major must see an adviser to discuss her/his program of study and to obtain an adviser code in order to gain access to the Tele-BEARS system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment “phase,” having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser codes will only be given out over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>




<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters and Science other than the requirements of the major.  For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="transferofcredit"></a>
<h4><strong>Transfer of Credit</strong></h4>




<p>Major advisers may credit courses taken at other institutions toward completion of the History of Art major at Berkeley.  This process is independent of the transfer of credit toward completion of L&amp;S requirements for graduation.  Transfer students should come to their first departmental advising appointment with copies of transcripts from all institutions they have previously attended as well as information about the content and requirements of the courses they wish to transfer. Transfer credit from community colleges is granted only for Lower Division requirements. Coursework from other universities or four-year colleges and from study abroad may be considered for Upper Division credit. For transfer of credit from study abroad, please see the Department Study Abroad Information sheet. Please note as well the residency requirements under &quot;Special Restrictions for all Majors.&quot;</p>




<h5><strong>AP Credit</strong></h5>




<p>Course credit may be given to students who receive a score of four or five on the Advanced Placement (AP) Examination in History of Art.  This credit may be to satisfy one lower division course requirement.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="suggestionsforallmajors"></a>
<h4><strong>Suggestions for All Majors</strong></h4>




<ol>
	<li><strong>Foreign languages</strong> are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses.  Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible.  Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in Ancient and Asian art.</li>
	<li><strong>Recommended courseload</strong> in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements.  In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</li>
	<li><strong>Special programs</strong>, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning.  If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad <u>must</u> be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted.  In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards.  Your performance will be evaluated by your adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the Department Study Abroad Information sheet.</li>
	<li>Students with special intellectual or pre-professional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (193, 199), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments.  These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</li>
</ol>




<hr/>




<a name="majorrequirements1"></a>
<h4><strong>Major Requirements</strong></h4>




<p>The Undergraduate Major comprises the following distribution of units: Lower Division (16); Upper Division (32): Total (48). </p>




<ol>
	<li><strong>Letter Grade:</strong>  All courses to be counted toward completion of the major <u>must be taken for a letter grade</u> except for the lower division studio art course and Art History 194 &amp; 199, which may only be taken Pass/Not Pass.</li>
	<li><strong>Declaring the History of Art major:</strong> Students must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course.</li>
	<li><strong>Summer School:</strong>  Two summer school courses at Berkeley or elsewhere may be credited toward completion of the major.</li>
	<li><strong>Residency:</strong>  A minimum of five upper division courses must be taken in the History of Art Department at Berkeley, of which one must be a seminar.</li>
	<li><strong>Approval of Other Courses:</strong>  Except for specific courses named as co-requisites, courses taken in other departments for credit in the major must be approved <u>in advance</u> by a faculty adviser.</li>
</ol>




<hr/>




<a name="departmentanduniversityhonors"></a>
<h4><strong>Department and University Honors</strong></h4>




<p><strong>Honors in Art History: </strong>Students with at least a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) in History of Art are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in the History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, H195 Special Study).  Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements.  Please see the Department Honors Program information sheet.</p>




<p>University Honors are awarded upon the recommendation of the department to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: honors, high honors and highest honors.  Requisite GPAs for both department and University honors change each year.</p>




<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards:  </strong>These awards recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year.  By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley.  Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid.  The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>




<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in Art History as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>




<hr/>




<a name="detailstoremember"></a>
<h4><strong>Details to Remember</strong></h4>




<h5><strong>Registration</strong></h5>




<p>Once you have declared your major in History of Art, <u>an appointment with an adviser is required every semester</u> in order to discuss and approve your academic program. Appointments should be made early, especially if you are unsure of what courses you plan to take.  Students who do not make early arrangements for appointments take the chance of not being able to see an adviser before the registration deadline.  Advisers are generally <u>not</u> available during the summer. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for information and late fees. At the beginning of each semester, the advisers will hold special office hours during the first and second weeks of classes to approve adds, drops or other changes in your program. Sign up for an appointment with an adviser.</p>




<h5><strong>Incompletes</strong></h5>




<p>Incompletes must be made up within the deadlines indicated below.  When the work is completed, you must complete a &quot;Petition to Remove Incomplete&quot; and then give it to the instructor along with your completed coursework; the instructor will then assign a grade and submit the form to the Undergraduate Student Services Adviser, where it will be sent to the Records Division at Sproul for processing.</p>




<p>Deadline for submitting completed work for Fall Incompletes: First day of instruction of the following fall semester.  Deadline for submitting completed work for Spring/Summer Incompletes:  First day of instruction of the following spring semester.</p>




<p><u>Incompletes in H195</u>:  If you are doing an Honors thesis during your final semester and receive an Incomplete <em>and</em> you do not need the Honors thesis course to satisfy major or L&amp;S requirements, you will graduate without receiving honors in History of Art. <u>If the Honors course is required to complete major or L&amp;S requirements, receiving an Incomplete grade will lead to the removal of your name from the degree list and automatically prevent graduation</u>.</p>




<h5><strong>Graduation Procedure</strong></h5>




<ol>
	<li><strong>A degree check in L&amp;S:</strong>  A degree check from the Office of Undergraduate Advising in L&amp;S (206 Evans Hall) should be done the semester before you graduate to make sure you have completed L&amp;S requirements.</li>
	<li><strong>Departmental Adviser's approval:  </strong>In order for students to be cleared by the Department for completion of the major, all categories on the major advising form must have the adviser's initials as approval for coursework taken.</li>
	<li><strong>Contact the College of Letters &amp; Science Office of Undergraduate Advising </strong>to confirm that you have completed requirements for Subject A, American History &amp; Institutions, and American Cultures. </li>
	<li><strong>Placing Yourself on the Degree List:  </strong>You must declare your candidacy to graduate during the semester in which you plan to meet all your degree requirements. You can do this through Tele-BEARS when you enroll for classes for your final semester, or by filing in person at the Office of the Registrar in the first eight weeks of your final semester (fee imposed after the third week).</li>
</ol>




<h5><strong>Letters of Recommendation</strong></h5>




<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses.  General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the Career Center (2111 Bancroft). </p>




<h5><strong>Graduate Study </strong></h5>




<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year.  Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>




<h5><strong>Brochures, Announcements, and Files</strong> </h5>




<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the Departmental bulletin board or distributed by email.  If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the Undergraduate Student Services Adviser.</p>




<h5><strong>Appeals</strong></h5>




<p>If, at any time, a student has a complaint, the department has an &quot;Undergraduate Grievance Procedure&quot; that should be followed.  A copy of this procedure may be obtained from the Undergraduate Student Services Adviser. Its purpose is to permit students in the History of Art Department to resolve complaints at the departmental level prior to filing complaints pursuant to the Berkeley Campus Student Grievance Procedure.</p>




<h5><strong>Undergraduate Association</strong></h5>




<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors.  In the past, the Association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars.  All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the Association.  If you would like more information please leave a message in the Association's mailbox in 416 Doe or see the Undergraduate Student Services Adviser.</p>

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">An introduction to the historical circumstances and visual character of Western art from the Renaissance to the present. Not a chronological survey, but an exploration of topics and themes central to this period. For example: What tasks did painting and sculpture perform in the past? For whom, at whose expense? How do the rise of landscape painting, the cult of the artist, and the new emphasis on the nude relate to the emergence of modern society? Do stylistic labels like Classicism, Realism, Impressionism, and Modernism help us answer such questions? This course is recommended for potential majors and for students in other disciplines, both humanities and sciences.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">The West's &quot;modern&quot; era had its beginnings in the 15th and 16th centuries. Social and economic organization, religious and political thought, were reconfigured into forms we recognize today. Within these configurations, art took on new roles: a commodity in a nascent capitalist society, a vehicle of propaganda by church and state, an expression of an individual's genius. In aesthetic terms, it took on properties which defined the modern. Italy and the Netherlands each contributed to the revolution in pictorial expression. This course investigates those contributions and considers how art expressed the world view of this age.

We will look, for instance, at Shaker watercolors and design; Puritan painting and city planning; Amish, Hawaiian, and Hmong quilting; the ledger drawings and domestic structures of specific Native American groups; and the sacred architecture of the Hispanic southwest. Our timeframe spans four centuries but our &quot;geographies&quot; will be very focused. We will consider vernacular or folk production within the context of politics and economics as well as aesthetic and social theory.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Mimesis, Greek for &quot;imitation&quot; is a key term in recent debates in a number of disciplines. However, what is at its core is often astonishingly undefined, open and ambivalent. Starting with antique and medieval works addressing key moments of mimesis we will also explore modern theories of mimesis. Crossing the threshold between pre-modern and modern examples will help us to understand the premises for the visual culture involving the rise of naturalism, and more generally the nature of representation in medieval and early modern culture.
