<div>
<p><span>It is important that you carefully consider the total financing of your education, from your first term at UC Berkeley to completing your degree. If financial help will be needed beyond the funds that you or your family are able to provide, you should make the necessary applications for financial assistance well in advance of enrollment. </span></p>
<p><span>You should pay particular attention to early deadlines for application for grants, scholarships, Federal Work-Study, Federal Perkins, and Federal Direct Loans. While the needs and resources of each student differ, the University can provide a general list of tuition and fees and expenses normally encountered. </span></p>
<p><strong><span><em>Note:</em> Fees are subject to change without notice.</span></strong></p>
</div>




<div>
<p>Part of your tuition and fees may be refunded if you cancel your registration before the opening day of the semester or withdraw before the beginning of the sixth week of classes of any semester. For specific information regarding this, please see the <a href="/archive/2013-14/tuitionfeesandfinancialaid/#tuitionfeestext" target="_blank">Tuition &amp; Fees page</a>
 of this bulletin.</p>

<p>Please note that the cost of attending the University varies according to individual circumstances. The expenses listed in this bulletin are approximate costs for the nine-month academic year and should be used only as a guideline.</p>

			<div id="tuitionfeestextcontainer" class="tab_content">
				<a name="tuitionfeestext"></a><h2>Required Tuition and Fees</h2>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/feesched.html" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar’s website</a>
 for current fee information. <strong>All tuition and fees are subject to change.</strong></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> In November 2010, the Regents approved changing the name of the Educational Fee to “Tuition;” the name of Fee for Selected Professional School Students to “Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition;&quot; and the name of Nonresident Tuition to “Nonresident Supplemental Tuition,” effective July 1, 2011.</p>
<h3>Student Services Fee</h3>
<p>This fee (formerly referred to as the University Registration Fee) is paid by all students and shall be used to support services and programs that directly benefit students and that are complementary to, but not a part of, the core instructional program. These services and programs include, but are not limited to, operating and capital expenses for services related to the physical and psychological health and well-being of students; social, recreational, and cultural activities and programs; services related to campus life and campus community; technology expenses directly related to the services; and career support. These services and programs create a supportive and enriched learning environment for University of California students.</p>
<h3>Tuition (formerly Educational Fee)</h3>
<p>Tuition is used to support a portion of the student services costs of the educational program, such as financial aid, social and cultural activities, Admissions and Registrar operations, counseling and career guidance, student affirmative action, and academic tutoring. In exceptional circumstances, tuition may be reduced by one-half for part-time undergraduate students. Approval of part-time undergraduate study is made only in exceptional cases and is based on considerations of occupation, family responsibility, and health. Applications must be approved by the appropriate dean before the start of each term. A tuition reduction will be made only if you enroll in no more than two courses.</p>
<h3>Berkeley Campus Fee</h3>
<p>This fee provides support for a wide range of activities sponsored by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), including work with academic and administrative units of the campus. It covers use of the Student Union, helps pay construction costs of the Union building and the Lower Sproul Project, and assists with the provision of ethnic studies on the Berkeley campus.</p>
<h3>Class Pass Transit Fee</h3>
<p>This fee, required of all students, gives students unlimited transportation on the local bus system (AC Transit).</p>
<h3>UC Berkeley Extension Fee</h3>
<p>Students enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension Fall Program for Freshmen are assessed fees through UC Berkeley Extension. For information, call (510) 643-0379.</p>
<h3>Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition (formerly Professional Degree Fee)</h3>
<p>Graduate students in the professional schools (Optometry, Business, Law, Public Health, Public Policy, Social Welfare, Information Management, Developmental Practice, Product Development, Translational Medicine and various programs in the Colleges of Environmental Design and Engineering) and the Health and Medical Sciences Joint Medical Program pay additional professional degree supplemental tuition. These amounts are available on the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar's website</a>
 and from the individual schools and programs.</p>

<h3>University Health Insurance Fee</h3>
<p>All students attending Berkeley must be covered by major medical health insurance. All students are therefore automatically enrolled in the University’s Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), which provides for specialized care and hospitalization and supplements campus care services provided by University Health Services (UHS) at the Tang Center. The cost for the plan is billed with tuition and registration fees each semester. Payment for both the fall and spring semesters provides major medical coverage for the entire calendar year, including summer. You may waive out of the University’s plan and not pay the fee if you can show proof of coverage comparable to the University’s plan. For more information, call (510) 642-2000 or visit the <a href="http://uhs.berkeley.edu/ship" target="_blank">UHS website</a>
.</p>

<h3>Nonresident Supplemental Tuition</h3>
<p>At the time of registration, students are classified as a resident or nonresident for tuition and fee purposes. Only US citizens and holders of immigrant visas can qualify for resident classification. Under California law you may be classified as a resident for tuition and fee purposes if you have lived in California for more than one year immediately before the day instruction begins at the last of the campuses to open for a semester. Residency is the combination of physical presence within California, intent to live in California permanently, plus demonstrated financial independence for the two years immediately preceding the request for residence classification. Nonresidents must pay nonresident supplemental tuition each semester. For detailed information regarding the establishment of California residence, please see the <a href="/archive/2013-14/registrationandenrollment/#residencyfortuitionpurposestext" target="_blank">California Residency section of this bulletin</a>
; or write to the Legal Analyst, Residence Matters, 1111 Franklin St., 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607-5200.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Additional Fees and Expenses</h2>
<h3>Document Management Fee</h3>
<p>New students are assessed a Document Management Fee which covers various transactions fees for documents and services, including official transcripts, verification of enrollments and degrees, certificates of completion, and one-time mailing of diplomas, for the lifetime of the degree.</p>
<h3>Late Registration Fee</h3>
<p>A $150 late registration fee will be charged to all students who fail to become officially registered by the end of the third week of instruction each semester. To be officially “registered,” a student must be enrolled in at least one course; pay at least 20% of assessed tuition and registration fees; and have no active registration blocks.</p>
<h3>Late Fee Payment</h3>
<p>Payments must be received, not postmarked, by the deadline indicated on the Campus Accounts Receivable System (CARS) statement. All other delinquent accounts more than $50 will be assessed penalties as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>$20 on accounts one month past due</li>
	<li>$25 on accounts two months past due and monthly thereafter until the account is brought current.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Returned Check Charges</span></h3>
<p>A processing charge of $50 is assessed when the bank returns a check for payment of tuition and registration fees. A processing charge of $20 is assessed for all other returned checks.</p>
<h3>Reinstatement after Having Been Dropped from University Rolls</h3>
<p>$10</p>
<h3>Collection Costs</h3>
<p>Additional costs may be assessed on any defaulted debts requiring remedial collection activity. These costs may include applicable attorney’s fees.</p>
<h3>Cal Intercollegiate Athletics</h3>
<p>Student season tickets are available for purchase <a href="http://www.calbears.com/" target="_blank">here</a>
 for football and men’s basketball, while supplies last. Admission to other regular season home events is free to all currently registered full-time Berkeley students with student ID.</p>

</ul>
<p>For detailed information about the various types of financial aid available to Berkeley students, please see the <a href="http://financialaid.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Financial Aid and Scholarships Office website</a>
. </p>

<p>Students apply for financial aid by submitting a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">online</a>
, or if a Dream Act student, by submitting a California Dream Act Application <a href="http://www.csac.ca.gov/dream_act.asp" target="_blank">online.</a>
 The deadline for applying is March 2. </p>

<p>All financial aid <span class="Bodyitalic">except</span> fellowships, honorary scholarships, teaching and research appointments, and prizes is granted on the basis of financial need. Financial need is the difference between the cost of attendance for the academic year and the amount you and your family can contribute toward those costs. Prizes are awarded on the basis of competition or outstanding ability in some area of creative or scholarly endeavor. Most scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic performance and financial need.</p>
<p>Much of the funding for graduate students comes from sources other than the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. Fellowships are awarded through the Graduate Division. Information and applications are available at the Graduate Division, 318 Sproul Hall.</p>
<h3>Reserve Officers Training Corps</h3>
<p>The University of California, as a land-grant institution established by the Morrill Act of 1862, offers courses and programs in military training. This training is voluntary and affords you the opportunity to qualify for a commission as an officer in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps while completing your college education. Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) courses are offered by three departments: Aerospace Studies (Air Force), Military Science (Army), and Naval Science (Navy and Marine Corps). Scholarship programs are available; they carry a monthly stipend and pay for tuition, books, and most fees for qualified students. Individual programs are described under Military Officers Education Program in the Courses and Curricula section of this catalog.</p>
<h3>Veterans’ Educational Benefits</h3>
<p>UC Berkeley’s Veteran Services unit in the Office of the Registrar provides veterans and their dependents the information and assistance required to seamlessly receive veterans’ educational benefits while pursuing their academic careers at Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Veteran Services unit serves as a liaison between the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and UC Berkeley students eligible for federal veterans’ educational benefits, and assists students eligible for the California Department of Veterans Affairs College Fee Waiver (Cal Vet) program.</p>
<p>For detailed information about initiating and receiving veterans educational benefits at Berkeley, please visit <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/veterans.html" target="_blank">our website</a>

<h4>Fellowships, Graduate Scholarships, and Academic Appointments for Graduate Students</h4>
<p>Numerous programs—from fellowships, grants-in-aid, and loans to assistantships, subsidized housing, and child care programs—provide ways in which you can reduce the costs of graduate school. Some of the programs are need-based and are administered through the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. Others are merit-based and are administered through the Graduate Services: Fellowships and Appointments Offices and the academic departments. For detailed information about all the sources available to you, consult the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Application for Admission and Fellowships</a>
.</p>

<h3>Fellowships and Graduate Scholarships</h3>
<p>Applications for University fellowships and graduate scholarships are considered only once a year. Awards are made for the academic year beginning with the fall semester. U.S. citizens and permanent residents should complete the “Free Application for Federal Student Aid” (FAFSA) for determination of financial need.</p>
<h3>Fellowship Application Procedure</h3>
<p>If you are applying for admission/fellowship, you must file the combined <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Application for Admission and Fellowships</a>
, according to instructions included in the application. </p>

<p>If you are applying for admission for the spring semester, you should see your department for a financial award to begin the following fall semester.</p>
<p>If you are a continuing or returning graduate student at Berkeley, you may obtain the necessary fellowship application materials from your department or graduate group. For a list of funding opportunities throughout the year, visit the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/deadlines.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Fellowships website</a>
.</p>

<p>The fellowship application deadlines for new students range from early December to late January, depending on the department; see the <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/index.shtml" target="_blank">Graduate Application for Admission and Fellowships</a>
 for deadlines. Continuing students should see their departments before January 5.</p>

<h3>Announcement of Awards</h3>
<p>Awards are announced by March 1 and must be accepted or declined, in writing, by April 15.</p>
<h3>Fellowship Supplementation</h3>
<p>Fellows receiving stipends plus fees (the latter from either fellowship or academic appointments) may be subject to an employment restriction: students may work up to 25% during the academic year (that is, 25 percent each term or 50 percent for one term only). There is no work restriction for the Summer term.</p>
<p>Additional fellowships are announced monthly in eGrad, our online newsletter. To sign up for eGrad, email gradpub@berkeley.edu and put &quot;eGrad mailing list&quot; in the subject line.</p>
<h3>Graduate Diversity Program (GDP)</h3>
<p>GDP provides a foundation of active support for underrepresented students through a number of important services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Outreach visits throughout the country</li>
	<li>Academic advising/mentoring throughout the student’s academic career</li>
	<li>Undergraduate research opportunities</li>
	<li>Advice on applying to graduate school</li>
	<li>Monthly seminars on professional development</li>
	<li>Career advice/planning</li>
	<li>Networking opportunities on campus</li>
</ul>
<p>Underrepresented students will find social and academic support in the numerous student organizations on campus, such as those listed on the <a href="http://ga.berkeley.edu/projects/gmsp" target="_blank">Graduate Minority Students’ Project website</a>
. In addition, the University maintains discipline-based student diversity programs in engineering, the humanities, public health, and the biological, physical, and social sciences. For information regarding opportunities and support on behalf of diversity, contact the Graduate Diversity Program, 104 California Hall #1500; (510) 642-7294; e-mail grad.diversity@berkeley.edu; or visit the <a href="http://diversity.berkeley.edu/graduate/gdp" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>

<h4>Graduate Student Academic Appointments</h4>
<p>Academic appointments are an important source of financial support for Berkeley graduate students, although their availability varies from department to department. As part of an offer of admission, some departments may propose a combination of teaching and research appointments as part of a financial support package. Other departments may expect graduate students to arrange for appointments once they have been admitted.</p>
<p>Graduate students appointed by the University to most academic titles must meet minimum academic requirements, such as GPA and a limit on incomplete grades, and be registered and enrolled in at least 12 units of 100- to 200-level courses per semester until they are advanced to doctoral candidacy. Units in the 600 series may be substituted for 200-level units when appropriate. Lower division units taken to prepare for departmental requirements (languages, mathematics, statistics) may be substituted for 100-level units. Most graduate student academic appointments are eligible for tuition and fee remissions in addition to salary. For more information on eligibility requirements and the availability of appointments, contact the department for which you wish to work. Departments occasionally may list openings with the Career Center.</p>
<p>Graduate students are restricted to working no more than half time regardless of the positions they hold. To ensure proper academic progress, the University may not appoint candidates for higher degrees in any capacity at more than half time during the academic year without the express consent of the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies. Summer appointments may be full time.</p>
<p>Graduate student instructors (GSIs), acting instructors (AI-GS), readers, tutors, nursery school assistants, and community teaching fellows are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Automobile Workers (UAW). Under the language of the contract, students hired in these titles are referred to as ASEs (academic student employees). You will find this acronym used in the contract and in campus communications. ASEs should familiarize themselves with the contract; see the <a href="http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/labor/contracts/BX" target="_blank">Labor Relations website</a>
. Information on anticipated appointments for the next academic year can be found on the <a href="http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/labor/contracts/BX/job-opportunities/expected" target="_blank">Labor Relations website</a>
.</p>

<h3>Teaching Appointments</h3>
<p>Many departments make GSI positions available to qualified graduate students. GSIs must be registered full-time students and are limited to working half time or less. They are chosen for scholarly achievement and promise as teachers, and they serve under active supervision of the regular faculty. Some departments require their students to complete a specified minimum period of teaching as part of their PhD programs.</p>
<p>Graduate students who do not speak English as a native language and do not hold a bachelor’s degree from an institution in the United States must pass a test of spoken English before they can be appointed as graduate student instructors. If you have taken the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Internet-Based Test (iBT), your speaking section score will be used to determine your proficiency. If you have not taken the TOEFL iBT and need to demonstrate oral English proficiency, the Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) will be administered at Berkeley.</p>
<p>For further information on the Language Proficiency Program (testing and courses), visit the GSI Teaching and Resource Center <a href="http://gsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">website. </a>
For information on the TOEFL visit <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>

<h3>Research Appointments</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified registered full-time graduate student, you may seek a research appointment in the departments, centers, and institutes of the University. Graduate student researchers (GSRs) perform research broadly related to their degree programs in an academic department or research unit under the direction of a faculty member or authorized principal investigator. The duration and extent of such an appointment may vary. If interested, you should apply directly to the department, center, or institute in which you wish to work.</p>
<h3>Stipends and Tuition and Fee Remissions</h3>
<p>Stipend figures for all positions mentioned above are subject to US income tax deductions. If you are offered an appointment, you should obtain information about payment schedules, since payment for work performed is later than the deadline for payment of tuition and registration fees. For teaching appointments, payment is usually in five equal installments per semester.</p>
<p>Some appointments carry a benefit called a fee remission, which offsets either a portion or all of your assessed tuition and fees.

<p>The Undergraduate Student Budgets represent the average amounts paid by UC students in various housing situations. The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office updates these figures annually through student surveys and other research. The Student Budget is a major factor in setting the amount of financial aid you may receive; your budget is based on the housing option you selected on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) until your housing status is confirmed by the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. The Student Budget is subject to change. These amounts are the most recent estimates available as of July 18, 2013.</p>
