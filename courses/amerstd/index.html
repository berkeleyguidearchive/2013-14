This course examines the 1930's and 1940's topically, studying the work of the New Deal, corporate responses to the Depression and war, the important connections between architecture and advertising, the role of the Museum of Modern Art in the promotion of Modernism, the concept of the ideal house, and key tests, theories, and projects from the period.

We will study the nature and extent of this motif in recent American culture (including its expression in literature, music, and popular idioms) as well as situate our discussions within the context of historical expressions of the American journey as cyclical, eschatological, or as a journey to oblivion. Drawing on selections from, among others, Walt Whitman, Josiah Royce, James Baldwin, Jack Kerouac, and Maya Angelou, we will discuss the notion of journey in terms of possibility, nostalgia, nectar, cynicism, self-deception, and disappointment. Students will be encouraged to consider--and write about--their own relation to this expressive tradition in American cultural history.

It was as an immigration station that Angel Island had the most profound effect on individual lives and for which the island is now known.

We will review the socioeconomic and political conditions that shaped the formation and development of San Francisco's Chinatown and the lives of its people from the community's beginnings in the 1850's to the present day. In the process, we will also examine how distinct social institutions and Chinatown culture developed in response to life in America, particularly to immigration policies, the anti-Chinese movement, acculturation and assimilation forces, new gender roles and relationships, and U.S.-China politics.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">Westward expansion and the frontier experience have long assumed a mythical status as formative events in the annals of American culture, providing Americans with a collective cultural history and space for fantasy. Within this story there has been little room for women: westward expansion has been encoded as a male activity, and the American West has served a proving ground for the definition of American manhood. However, recent research on frontier women's history has shown that white and non-white women were present on all frontiers and in all phases of American expansion to the West. Moreover, white, literate women wrote copiously in, on, and about western frontiers--in letters and diaries, travel and settlement narratives, reminiscences and autobiographies, poems, stories, and novels. Reading from a diversity of women's texts, we will explore gender together with race and class in order to understand the women's frontier. This course will roughly follow a chronological line from the 1830s into the first decades of the 20th century.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">American society is fragmented, divided, and often polarized. Race, class, and at times culture serve as boundaries which separate and reinforce distinctions, creating many different Americas within the U.S. How one sees America tends to be intimately related to the environment in which one lives, the social status and class one occupies, and the historical experience of the individual or the group with which one identifies. Yet, there are also forces which bind Americans together and which have produced a culture that transcends various forms of difference to create a common American identity. This course will explore the nature of those forces that divide and unite the peoples of the U.S. Through literature, film, and social science, we will attempt to identify the ingredients of the glue that holds this society together and gives the concept of America meaning.
