<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">American sports and athletes have come to signify a complex of variegated meanings that include desire, but also disdain. Through the work of a variety of scholars, researchers, and journalists, this course explores the nature and motives of societal structures and practices (embodied in both institutions and individuals) to illuminate the intersections and reciprocal influences of society and sports. The central framework of this course draws on the notion that the space of sports is defined by highly structured societal practices and consumptions. By critically analyzing a variety of these practices, this course attempts to ground a partial reading of other societal forces in American culture. In particular, the course examines the nuanced intersections of sport, race, ethnicity, social class and gender, highlighting the ways in which American sports provide a potential vehicle for social mobility and integration while simultaneously reproducing existing cultural stereotypes and structures of inequality.

The course begins with a discussion of Erikson's psychosocial theory and the sociocultural perspectives of Vygotsky and other theorists. We then review some of the major psychosocial variables related to educational achievement, including competence, motivation, self-concept, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and volition. We touch briefly on moral development and values as psychosocial factors affecting correlates. We examine (a) how social and personal identity factors are used to explain underachievement (e.g., cultural ecological theory and stereotype threat), (b) the role of identity in different cultural groups, (c) the impact of these factors on teacher and student behavior, and (d) the role that identity plays in helping students develop a sense of future.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">This course deals with issues related to language learning and development in school-age children. How do they acquire the language skills needed for literacy and academic development? How do children make the transition from home to school language use? How do children learn a second language? What happens when learning a second language results in the loss of the first language? We will consider the educational, social and cognitive implications of these issues.

For the past 20 years, this theory and method for analyzing human development has made important contribution to our understanding of how we learn to become competent members of community, how we learn through language, and how we are socialized into language. This course will provide opportunities to overview the theoretical cornerstones of language socialization as a field of study, as well as review current studies and chart future research trajectories. Course participants are expected to collect and analyze audio/video data from any educational and other learning context where language socialization might be taking place.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">The study of narrative has solidified into an important body of literature that is of particular relevance to educators. Across learning contexts, narrative is a ubiquitous literacy tool, and as such, it underlies many learning activities. We tell narratives for their potency to explain, rationalize, and delineate past, present, and possible experience. This narrative act is a collaborative undertaking, co-told and designed with the audience's input, addressing an audience's present and future concerns. Narrative can thus potentially create shared understandings and community among those participating in narrative activity, yet narratives can become sites for rejection and contestation. Narrative is also a socializing tool. The course will also address methodological approaches to the study of narrative that are relevant to the field of education. Students enrolled in this course are expected to collect narrative samples from naturally occurring interactions (video and audio-taped conversation, classroom interaction), written narrative texts, or other.

By considering how reading is differently conceived and realized in a wide range of contexts, this course will shed light on reading as a historically contingent, ideologically shaped, and socio-culturally organized practice. More specifically, this course has a twofold aim: 1) to introduce students to recent ethnographic research on reading practices; 2) to familiarize them with ethnographic methodology. To this scope, in addition to reading exemplary studies of reading practices, students will also conduct a small-scale ethnographic research project in settings of their choice.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">The cultural study of sport examines the ways in which institutionalized physical activity embodies and reflects social meanings and identities. The social practice of sport provides a space in which dominant discourses of race, gender, and social class are reproduced and resisted. As these physical activities become institutionalized, commercialized, and embedded within educational institutions themselves, individuals must navigate a nuanced and often conflicted terrain in their respective participation and performance. This course, then, examines the role of sport in society broadly and the relationship of sport and education more specifically. The curriculum reviews the writing and research on sport and education from a sociological, psychological, and philosophical perspective, with a particular focus on the constructed divide of mind and body, as manifested in the institutional conflicts between school and sport.

What is the work (and workplace) for which teachers are being prepared? What is the occupational conception of teaching that underpins practice, policy, and research? What is the significance of teacher education's fluctuating fortunes and shifting institutional forms? What is the field's capacity for research on teacher education? By comparison with research on teaching and learning, research on the education of teachers has been under-developed both conceptually and methodologically. Throughout the course, we will be judging the accomplishments and limitations of this field of practice and study, and locating opportunities for future research and development.

The course aims at developing and refining judgment by looking in-depth at improvement strategies, interventions, or levers for change employed by urban school districts. Given that the theme of the course is school improvement and, given LEEP students' administrative and leadership expertise, the course is envisioned as an opportunity for deep reflection and exchange among knowledgeable actors.

In the fall, students began to identify a field of interest in which they most likely will conduct their research and write their dissertation. Also beginning in the fall, students familiarized themselves with templates for types of dissertations suggested for LEEP students. The second course in the milestone sequence assumes that students have made a selection of a field of interest and are ready to explore its knowledge base. The purpose of the course is to make this exploration fruitful and research-based, and for students to take first steps in applying their new knowledge to a dissertation project of a specific type. At the end of the course, students should be ready to pass the first milestone towards the dissertation: a paper mapping the professional knowledge base in their field of interest. At a later date, this paper will be submitted as one of three qualifying papers to the oral exam committee.

Specific areas of emphasis will be on maximizing the effective use of educational resources (e.g., financial analyses, budget techniques, cost analyses, management information systems), understanding the constraints that influence public school expenditures (e.g., state and federal legislation), and accomplishing the educational objectives of the school system through financial application (cost analysis and project management techniques). The underlying assumption of the course is that informed financial leadership can improve the opportunity to achieve educational achievement and equity in public school organizations.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">What is globalization? What are the implications of living in a &quot;global world&quot; for educational systems? In this course, we explore these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization. We will then discuss several major developments associated with globalization that are affecting different levels of education (from primary to university) including the rise in accountability and testing, skills for the &quot;knowledge&quot; economy, and immigration. We will consider the role of international organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations in shaping international policy and programs. We will also examine the role that the state, local communities, and non-governmental agencies play in providing and improving the quality of education. In the final part of the course, we examine topics including language policy, technology, and strategies to combat educational inequality. To explore these topics, we will read and discuss case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the United States to provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the context and content of education internationally.

<p class="courseblockdesc block"><span class="descshow">During the fall semester, students complete 294A in which the preliminary Leadership Action Research Project is designed - a summative assessment for the Principal Leadership Institute and the MA program at Berkeley. Through the LARP process, students engage in a cycle of inquiry about a problem or concern that matters to their overall leadership agenda and creates more equitable spaces in urban schools. In this course, students solidify the design of their LARP, take leadership action to implement their action plan, reflect on the action plan, revise the action plan - and make changes as appropriate - thus, engaging actively in the cycle of inquiry.
