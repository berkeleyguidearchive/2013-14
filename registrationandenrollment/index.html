				<a name="withdrawtext"></a><h2><span>Cancellation or Withdrawal of Registration</span></h2>
<p>If you do not wish to attend the University for a semester and instruction has not yet begun, you must formally request a cancellation of your registration from the University. If instruction has already begun and you find it necessary to stop attending classes, you must formally request a withdrawal from the University. Whether you cancel or withdraw, any classes in which you are enrolled will be dropped from your schedule, and you will no longer be eligible to attend for that semester or any future semester until you are readmitted.</p>

				<a name="residencyfortuitionpurposestext"></a><h2 class="appendixbody">California Residency and the Non-Resident Supplemental Tuition</h2>
<p>If you have not been living in California with the intent to make it your permanent home for more than one year immediately before the residence determination date for each semester in which you propose to attend the University, you must pay a non-resident supplemental tuition fee in addition to all other tuition and fees. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at UC Berkeley.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Law Governing Residence</h2>
<p>The rules regarding legal residence for tuition and fee purposes at the University of California are governed by the California Education Code as adopted by Standing Order 110.2 of The Regents of the University of California. Under these rules, adult citizens or certain classes of aliens can establish residence for tuition and fee purposes. There are also particular rules that apply to the residence classification of minors.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Who Is a California Resident?</h2>
<p>If you are an adult who is a US citizen or permanent resident and you want to be classified as a resident for tuition and fee purposes, you must have established your continuous presence in California more than one year immediately preceding the residence determination date for the semester during which you propose to attend the University, and you must have given up any previous residence. If you are not a US citizen or permanent resident and carry a non-immigrant visa, some visas may preclude you from establishing residency (i.e. B, F, J, TD/TN). You must also present objective evidence that you intend to make California your permanent home. Evidence of intent must be dated one year before the term for which you seek resident classification. If these steps are delayed, the one-year duration period will be extended until you have demonstrated both continuous presence and intent for one full year. Physical presence within the state solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residence under state law, regardless of the length of your stay. Your residence cannot be derived from your spouse nor, since you are an adult, from your parents. Likewise, a registered domestic partner does not derive residence from the other registered domestic partner.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Establishing Intent to Become a California Resident</h2>
<p>Indications of your intent to make California your permanent residence can include registering to vote and voting in California elections; designating California as your permanent address on all school and employment records, including military records if you are in the military service; obtaining a California driver’s license or, if you never had a driver’s license from any state, a California Identification Card; obtaining California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident, including taxes on income earned outside California from the date you establish residence; establishing a California residence in which you keep your permanent belongings; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indications in other states during any period for which you claim California residence. Documentary evidence is required. All relevant indications will be considered in determining your classification. Your intent will be questioned if you return to your prior state of residence when the University is not in session.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Financial Independence Requirement</h2>
<p class="appendixbody">Effective fall 1993, if your parents do not meet the requirements to be considered California residents for tuition and fee purposes or if you were not previously enrolled in a regular session at any University of California campus, you will be required to be financially independent in order to be a resident for tuition and fee purposes. If you are an adult student and your parents are not California residents, you must demonstrate financial independence, along with physical presence and intent, when seeking resident classification for tuition and fee purposes. You are considered “financially independent” if one or more of the following applies:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You are at least 24 years of age by December 31 of the year you request residence classification;</li>
	<li>You are a veteran of the US Armed Forces;</li>
	<li>You are a ward of the court or both of your parents are deceased;</li>
	<li>You have legal dependents other than a spouse or registered domestic partner;</li>
	<li>You are married, a registered domestic partner, or a graduate or professional student and you were not/will not be claimed as an income tax deduction by your parents or any other individual for the tax year preceding the term for which you are requesting resident classification; or</li>
	<li>You are a single undergraduate student who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by your parents or any other individual for the two tax years immediately preceding the term for which you are requesting resident classification, and you can demonstrate self-sufficiency for those years and the current year.</li>
</ol>
<p class="appendixbody"><em><span class="Bodyitalic">Note: </span></em>Graduate students who are graduate student instructors, teaching or research assistants, or teaching associates employed at 49% time or more (or awarded the equivalent in University-administered funds, e.g., grants, stipends, fellowships) in the term for which resident classification is sought are exempt from the financial independence requirement.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">General Rules Applying to Minors</h2>
<p>If you are an unmarried minor (under age 18), the residence of the parent with whom you live is considered your residence. If you have a parent living, you cannot change your residence by your own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by the relinquishment of a parent’s right of control. If you live with neither parent, your residence is that of the parent with whom you last lived. Unless you are a minor present in the United States under the terms of a non-immigrant status which precludes you from establishing domicile in the United States, you may establish your own residence when both your parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. If you derive California residence from a parent, that residence must satisfy the one-year duration requirement.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Specific Rules Applying to Minors</h2>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Divorced/Separated Parents</span></h3>
<p class="appendixbody">If you want to derive California resident status from a California resident parent, you must move to California to live with that parent before your 18th birthday and establish the requisite intent and remain in California until school begins. Otherwise, you will be treated like any other adult coming to California to establish your legal residence.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Parent of Minor Moves from California</span></h3>
<p class="appendixbody">If you are a minor US citizen or eligible alien whose parent was a resident of California but who left the state within one year of the residence determination date, you are entitled to resident classification if you remain in California after your parent departs, enroll in a California public postsecondary institution within one year of your parent’s departure, and, once enrolled, attend continuously until you turn 18.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Self-Support</span></h3>
<p class="appendixbody">If you are a US citizen or eligible alien and are a minor and can prove that you lived in California for the entire year immediately before the residence determination date, that you have been self-supporting for that year, and that you intend to make California your permanent home, you may be eligible for resident status.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Two-Year Care and Control</span></h3>
<p class="appendixbody">If you are a US citizen or carry an eligible immigrant status and you lived continuously for at least two years before the residence determination date with an adult who was not your parent but was responsible for your care and control, and who, during the one year immediately preceding the residence determination date was a resident of California, you may be entitled to resident status. This exception continues until you become 18 and have resided in the state long enough to become a resident, as long as you continuously attend an educational institution.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Exemptions from Non-Resident Supplemental Tuition (Proof of Eligibility Is Required)</h2>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Member of the Military</span></h3>
<p>If you are a member of the US military stationed in California on active duty, unless you are assigned to a state-supported institution of higher education for educational purposes, you may be exempted from non-resident supplemental tuition. You must provide the residence deputy on campus with a statement from your commanding officer or personnel officer indicating the dates of your assignment to California and confirming that the assignment to active duty in the state is not for educational purposes. If you are a graduate or professional student, you are eligible for this exemption until you have resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident (366 days).</p>
<p>As an active duty member, you may be eligible for an exemption while continuously enrolled, during which time you must fulfill Federal Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) requirements in order to maintain waiver eligibility. You must be on active military duty in California for a period of more than 30 days on or during the residence determination date of the term for which the exemption is requested and whose domicile or permanent duty station is in California.</p>
<p>If you are an undergraduate, graduate, or professional student and a former active duty member of the military, you may be exempt from non-resident supplemental tuition if you were stationed in Calif­ornia and were on active duty for more than one year (366 days) immediately prior to being discharged from the military.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Spouse, Registered Domestic Partner, or Other Dependents of Military Personnel</span></h3>
<p>You may be exempt from payment of non-resident supplemental tuition if you are a dependent natural or adopted child, stepchild, registered domestic partner, or spouse of a member of the armed forces of the United States stationed in California on active duty. If you are a graduate or professional student, you will be entitled to this exemption until you have resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident (366 days). If you are enrolled in an educational institution and the member of the armed forces is transferred outside California where he or she continues to serve on active duty or retires from active duty, you will not lose your exemption until you have resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident (366) days.</p>
<p>If you are a student who is a dependent natural or adopted child, stepchild, spouse, or registered domestic partner of a member of the armed forces of the United Sates who is stationed in CA on active duty, you may be entitled to a resident classification. The student must be the dependent of a member of the armed forces who is stationed in California on active duty on the residence determination date or, after serving in California on active duty, has been transferred outside California where he continues to serve, or has retired from active duty immediately after serving in California.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Child, Spouse, or Registered Domestic Partner of Faculty Member</span></h3>
<p>To the extent funds are available, if you are an unmarried dependent child under age 21 or the spouse or registered domestic partner of a member of the University faculty who is a member of the Academic Senate, you may be eligible for a waiver of non-resident supplemental tuition. Confirmation of the faculty member’s membership in the Academic Senate must be secured each semester before this waiver is granted.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Child, Spouse, or Registered Domestic Partner of University Employee (Whose Assignment is Outside California)</span></h3>
<p class="appendixbody">If you are an unmarried dependent child, spouse, or registered domestic partner of a full-time University employee whose assignment is outside California (e.g., Los Alamos National Laboratory or the University of California Washington, D.C., Center), you may be eligible for a waiver of non-resident supplemental tuition. Your parent’s, spouse’s, or registered domestic partner’s employment status with the University must be ascertained each semester.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Child, Spouse, or Registered Domestic Partner of Deceased Public Law Enforcement or Fire Suppression Employee</span></h3>
<p>If you are the child, spouse, or registered domestic partner of a deceased public law enforcement or fire suppression employee who was a California resident and was killed in the course of fire suppression or law enforcement duties, you may be entitled to a waiver of non-resident supplemental tuition.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Dependent Child of a California Resident Parent</span></h3>
<p>If you have not been an adult resident of California for more than one year and you are a dependent child of a California resident parent who has been a resident for more than one year immediately before the residence determination date, you may be entitled to a waiver of non-resident supplemental tuition until you have resided in California for the minimum time necessary to become a resident as long as you maintain continuous attendance at an educational institution.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Native American Graduates of a Bureau of Indian Affairs High School</span></h3>
<p>If you are a graduate of a California high school operated by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, you may be eligible for an exemption from non-resident supplemental tuition.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Employee of a California Public School District</span></h3>
<p>Any person holding a valid credential authorizing service in the public schools of the state of California who is employed by a school district in a full-time certificate position may be eligible for a non-resident supplemental tuition waiver.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Student Athlete in Training at US Olympic Training Center, Chula Vista</span></h3>
<p>Any amateur student athlete in training at the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista may be eligible for a waiver of non-resident supplemental tuition until he or she has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Graduate of a California High School</span></h3>
<p>You may be entitled to an exemption from non-resident supplemental tuition if you attended high school in California for three or more years and graduated from a California high school (or attained the equivalent). You are not eligible for this exemption if you are a non-immigrant alien.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Spouses, Registered Domestic Partners, and Dependents of California Residents Killed in September 11, 2001, Terrorist Attacks</span></h3>
<p>If you are an undergraduate student who is a spouse, registered domestic partner, or dependent of a California resident killed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or the crash of United Airlines Flight 93, you may be eligible for an exemption from non-resident supplemental tuition. Eligible students must meet the financial need requirements for the Cal grant A program.</p>
<h3 class="appendixbody"><span class="Bodybold">Recipient or Child of a Recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor</span></h3>
<p>If you are a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor or the child of a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, you may be eligible for an exemption from non-resident supplemental tuition.</p>
<p class="appendixbody">For more information, please see the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/current_students/residency.html" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar's website</a>

<hr/>
<h2 class="hed3">Temporary Absences</h2>
<p>If you are a non-resident student who is in the process of establishing California residency for tuition and fee purposes and you leave California during non-academic periods (for example, to return to your former or parent’s home state), your presence in California will be presumed to be solely for educational purposes, and only convincing evidence to the contrary will rebut this presumption. Students who are in the state solely for educational purposes will not be classified as residents for tuition and fee purposes, regardless of the length of stay.</p>
<p>If you are a student who has been classified as a resident for tuition and fee purposes and you leave the state temporarily, your absence could result in the loss of your California residence. Again, only strong evidence will rebut the presumption that you are/were in California solely for educational purposes. The burden of proof will be on you to verify that you did nothing inconsistent with your claim of a continuing California residence during your entire absence.</p>
<p>If you are a minor student, your residence is determined by the residence of the parent(s) with whom you live or last lived, and you would not lose that residence unless you perform acts inconsistent with a claim of permanent California residence. Some steps that you (or your parent(s) if you are a minor student) should take to retain resident status for tuition and fee purposes are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Satisfy California resident income tax obligations. It should be noted that individuals claiming permanent California residence are liable for payment of income taxes on their total income, including income earned outside the state (abroad or in another state).</li>
	<li>Continue to use a California permanent address on all records (educational, employment, military, etc.).</li>
	<li>Attend an out-of-state public institution as a non-resident for the entire period of enrollment there.</li>
	<li>Retain your California voter’s registration and vote by absentee ballot.</li>
	<li>Maintain a California driver’s license and vehicle registration. If it is necessary to change your license or registration while temporarily residing in another state, the license must be changed back to California within 10 days of the date of return to the state, and the vehicle registration must be changed within 20 days of the date of return.</li>
	<li>Return to California during your vacation periods.</li>
</ol>
